The energy was missing
As much as I love rihanna, last year's was so much better. That being said, I'll still show Rihanna respect. Let's have tech n9ne perform next seasons Superbowl halftime show though.
Go RiRi ❤
Illuminati in the end?
Rihanna ablam yapıyor yine şovunu 💅🏻
I love Rihanna. She is so good at singing.
Ma reine ❤
Show!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rihana perfect
We found love:    Why she slowed down : Her belly was hurting and she had so much pain
I love Rihanna
Rihanna is my favorite song
Vorrei fare un discorso 😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳😘
Rihanna a maior e a melhor do mundo ❤️
Icons❤Era❤
DIVA FOREVER 👑
She killed 🔥🔥🔥
SLAYED
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
super❤

I can’t believe I’m still tearing up 😢
160 m👏
순산하세영
Super cool!
I wasn't sure if she was grabbing at her crotch as part of the dance or if she was checking to make sure her baby wasn't falling out.
That's so awesome. They nailed the effects
At z end she puts satanic symbols 😂😂😂😂😂what hpn to z ppls r they shouting for the devil act😂😂😂
Se Loko ! Simplesmente espetacular!
❤❤
Rihanna is nice shoo❤ilove you
Nuno on The guitar
I lack words to describe how fantasy this is
She literally threw up Illuminati at the end and y’all over hear sayin u tearing up from this may god open everyone’s eyes
Cómo se llaman todas las canciones que aparecen antes  de diamonds
How do people love these LipSync Performances ?
What does the triangle at the end mean?
❤
the dancers are something else
The queen.
4:58
Only legends produce works of art that last through generations... Flawless performance Riri
Una leggenda , adorabile…..  Oltretutto in cinta !!! a
Auguri ❤❤❤❤
The fact that was did this when she was prego  for 15 minutes W riri and her marshmallows
Il migliore show. L’energia emanata dai ballerini è magica, carica di energia pura. 
Sei giù di morale, sei stanco/a guardati e vivi queste corografie!!
U can notice her evil face reaction in this concert 100 percent 666 even z stage can express anti Christ cross n her red secrfice cloth 😢
Rihanna is so strong and  she is pregnant after all and I love the music ❤❤🎤🎤
❤❤❤❤❤
The back up dancers are like one machine!
Rihanna killed it!
Horrible 😔
Coreografia tosca
Simplesmente fantástico 💟
Keren mba Rihana ❤❤❤❤😊
🤑❤️👋👋👋👋👋👋
❤meu DEUS pegou fogo top top top
I love you Rihanna, i miss you!❤🇭🇺
Am I the only one that thought it wasnt that great? Clearly shes singing to a recorded track, shes also relying a lot on her back up singers to sing for her (google it shes known for not really singing (with example the 777 tour years ago) when she invited fans and journalists to come on tour with her. Also those stupid disracting eskimo dancers are annoying as f and its like shes wearing a red sleeping bag
migalhas p fã
The best performance at super bowl halftime show❤❤
Gesafel better
It was the tampons chasing the period for me🤣but I love it❤️
the symbol of illuminati had to be...
Watching this through the heart of Chris Brown😪
존나 멋있다...
I just started watching it and boom it ends. 13 min just flew by. The most memorable performance ever. Those dancers men, how many of them are there. 500 😂 omg. Who rehersed them, where, how. So so impressed
This whole production of performance is absolutely 🔥🔥🙁
been here multiple times
What a performance
How much are he side performers being paid to do those dances?
Fantastic performance.
Let's be honest we all came to see the part where she plays : Diamonds 🔹
The chicken 🐔 dance as she slowly floats up . Is just beautiful 😢 💯
Go Go Go to the 160 melion view ❤❤❤❤
3 months later and I’m still listening to this, it has to be one of the top 5 performances!!
I love Riri ❤
6:14 honesty gives me thriller vibes
She did not perform this is what you came for
“O’ death…O’ death why don’t you spare my another year..”
Rihanna...always charming💖
Diosa😍😍
Can anyone tell me if Rihanna is singing or lip syncing? 😵‍💫
AWESOME A PRO LIFE ADVOCATE, the ultimate acceptance of having a child!

And NOT TERMINATING THE CHILD….

Love you riahannn

J'adore Rihanna est trop belle avec son ventre ❤❤❤❤😊😊🎉🎉
She is beautiful
One of the most mind blowing and powerful half times shows ever.
❤❤
OMG RIHANNA IM HER FAN !  Hope she’s doing good ! GOD GOOOD SINGING
The fact that she was pregnant and performed for over 15 minutes. High in the air and dancing without a care in the world. Rhianna truly loves her passion and her fans. She went through all of that in heavy makeup, high-powered lights. And all the backup dancers working in thick white coats... WOW. 
Rhianna, you are so beyond amazing. I wish you and your children all the happiness in the world.
Love you girl
Nobody is going to talk about 13:02
Nobody is going to talk about 14:01
13:04
Soy tu fan riannaaaa
good performance but it wont be remembered like others... The super bowl halftime show is special because you normally get to see a bunch of artist show up, some that you truly didnt expect... eminem with dre, 50 cent, mary j, snoop... to katy perry with Missy Elliot.  Those are the ones that people talk about for years....
✨✨✨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑✨✨✨💫💫💫🌺🌎❤️💫💫💫✨✨✨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✈️✨✨✨
So I just learned that you can actually make a fart go silent if you pull your buttcheek a bit to the side. Is that what's she's doing at 4:37?😂
10000000000000
Pop😊😊
I❤it
Can't stop watching this performances... Riri is a Gem 💎
the only thing i love about America is that they don't consider marriage, pregnancy and kids as end of woman's career.. she being pregnant and performing on such big event is amazing!
❤
BRAZILIAN FUNK 🇧🇷

How are there so many dancers and how did they make it until the end of the routine
Trump supporters and Karens do not approve
Why do I have to watch this every morning 😭😂😂🤲🤲
For someone who was preggo and hadn’t performed in a while, she killed it. We love you Riri. Hope you come back one day 😢
Queen 😢
Décevant, elle s’est contente du minimum.
The best half time show ever
Best show ever next only to Prince

Беременность это не болезнь . Можно и танцевать и петь ! Если хорошее самочувствие !
Just say hello to the queen
Она всегда одевается ужасно . Нет стиля . Нет вкуса . Ладно хоть голос нормальный.
This is 🤩
i didn’t expect this concert to have a football game in it
Já não sei quantas vezes voltei aqui 😍😍 espetáculo
Pura exaltação a baal, quem tá ligado, tá ligado ✡️
The fact that there are still a lot of great songs in her catalogue that didn’t get played speaks volumes
ameiiii
4:55 какую то музыку напоминает?
Confesse, você ainda vem aqui assistir a esse espetáculo.

The fact that Rihanna is pregnant & isn’t doing the most complex dance moves yet this is all still such an effective & amazing performance! Everything about this worked so perfectly! 💖
I watch this like thousand times already.  Rihanna is so legendary
o gente, o quanto eu amo essa mulher não tá escrito ❤
I really want to meet Rihanna
Essa mulher é demais muito talentosa e linda❤❤
I’m sorry I did not like this performance. Rihanna is from the Caribbean. She did not bring that part of the performers out J Lo, Shakira and  Beyoncé brought their culture! Rihanna did not bring nothing but a baby bump. I was expecting more than this! It was lackluster, and trash The visuals were cute but they would have been better if she brought her Barbadoes or the Jamaican culture to the stage this was supposed to be epic for her, and this was her worst epic performance in my opinion!
Oh my god i am. Ahuge fan of Rihanna ❤❤❤❤❤❤ 
I love Her music 😊😊
she is a hit factory.
Show incrível, não me canso de assistir
Yuo is zoo cool
Almost makes me wish I'd watched the super bowl. Rhianna is iconic.
lol i cant stop watching her shes the goat at singing
Гайс сори, мне похуй на ваш Бол. Я восхищаюсь Риханой. 😂Она крутая детка.

04:18 Quem veio assistir depois de saber que foi um Dj Brasileiro que fez esse remix. curti aqui.
Is not hard to think
But as i said, Rihanna super bowl show would boring, and that's a reality
Maroon 5 show was most fun than Rihanna show
She should pay the money
I have nightmares about being on high elevations, but she does it in real life.
Those dancers brought it

04:03 please she’s so cute 🥹
Don't be hipnotized by this........ Remember there are allot of problems right now..... This ishhh is gassed up, for real..... Superbowl halftime show is a cornball event..... Put them in clown costumes and have them dance in flames........... we know who tricks the world we also know who truly has control of it.
She has a great discography.  That said, I found this pretty underwhelming.   This is a halftime show that needed another performer
Her voice ❤❤❤❤
🎉🎊🍾🎉🎊🎉🍾🍾☀❤
hiiiii
boss riri...!!!
Choreography ❤🔥
The whole point is directly after a superbowl performance people are hypnotized into suddenly wanting to go relisten to your music, whether it’s good or not. And so you make a whole nother dump truck of money off streaming. Whether you deserve it or not.
I really feel left aside hearing and seeing several testimonies from people on profits they make from Bitcoin/Forex Investment... Can someone recommend a good expert that trade on my behalf and generate profit for me.

5:10 Mariah Angeliq humillando a Rihanna en su propio Show 😂 digan lo que quieran pero yo escuche su voz clarita de fondo😂❤
Queen Riri! 💎👸👑
OMG, did you see that platform she's standing on jump at the end?  Heck no!!!  Stunning performance, I would have expected nothing less :)
😘
Tbh Rihanna ate that performance up
Mișto. Oi fiți mișto totul pe el fac
Classicos que ate hoje toca o coração ❤😢
That was so amazing I'm not over it yet
On a scale from Black Eyed Peas to Prince, I'd give this halftime show a Rihanna.
❤❤❤❤top
I don't know but I am thinking to think that Rihanna think she is the best ever  I am thinking to think that she is arrogant.
Hats off to Rihanna and dancers are lit.
What comes after 7?!?!?

AAATEEEEE😝🍽🍽🍽🍽

Love you Riri you slayed this!!!
Tu chantes très bien
Would like to see Nicki-M Next

Thank you to all who contributed to this fantastic show. It’s a work of art.

Britney n Xtina very deserved to perform duets at Superbowl. Because they are legend icon pop teenager.

Η Rihanna's είναι μια σπουδαία καλλιτέχνις, αλλά το να τραγουδά ενώ είναι έγκυος είναι λίγο επικίνδυνο, λόγω του άγχους που μπορεί να προκαλέσει
LA UNICA MUJER EMBARAZADA DE LA HISTORIA HACER ESTA PRESENTACION EN EL SUPERBOWL BABE WOOO SUPER PRESENTACION CON MUCHA ENERGIA Y BUENA PREPARACION DE TODA ESA MULTITUD DE BAILARINES,BUENA ADAPTACION POR SU ESTADO, lo imposible para una mujer no existe bam

This is absolutely the best ever performance at superball events.  Mrs RIHANA is highly invited to perform at the all African cup of Nations. My humble opinion for Fenty style

I am surprised by people's support and positive comments despite seeing the last step I made at the end.. What happened to you people? We are all under the rule of demons،
Красотка, трудяга и умница!
К сожалению, не могу представить такой уровень выступления от наших звёзд, даже не в положении. А тут вообще эпический уровень
so can we all talk about how one of the dancers was doing a TikTok dance😂😂 love their energy
Rihanna is courageous being pregnant and performing simply incredible ♥️♥️
Every time I watch I love it more and more 💃🏾🔥♥️
All of the concert is live ??
I’m a fan
Brilliant!!... awesome dancing !
🎉
Are you preg
Valentino baby

Illuminati's new baby is coming soon, he is very excited to welcome her along to the followers in the concert 💀
Perfect
Pregnant, suspended in the air dancing, then she causally touches up her make-up truly the best half time show
Para mi es la mejor del siglo
I swear the dancers r so cute 😭
Se escucha bajo el vídeo
I liked it
4:16 😮

We found love is my absolute favorite song of all time!
Whoa no way Rihanna is pregnant. Well those dancers are really doing their job by Rihanna. I was doing nothing in Omak cause I don’t believe she is pregnant. Does she have a baby shower? Damn I’m holding for a girl but I’m just saying.

ПОТРЯСАЮЩАЯ!! СМЕЛАЯ!! УДИВИТЕЛЬНАЯ!!
It is admirable how much she influences people, and normalises pregnancy/ pregnant figures. The world screams for such influences.  Although I am not a fun of her music, who doesn't love Rihanna? Well done x
I would give birth during all of that
<3
No disrespect but why is she so powerful?  Do you ever wonder? You should.
Love Rihanna❤❤❤
❤
Good
Nice
Haram
Lesson: If you're pregnant, just stay at home and have maternity leave. lol
Yohw, I got this performance on repeat. This art is so great  I hope we will be seeing more from her this year. Let the baby get more Super Star performing experience ....

❤❤❤
She's satanic - adrenochrome like every in Hollywood!
Best superbowl halftime show ever! (Prince was at the top too) some people don't understand this was her first time performing in over 7 years and all Rihanna fans have been DIEING to see her perform and she absolutely killed it! ❤ as per usual. Huge fan. Always have been since Pon de Replay and always will be!!! 🙌🏻👑
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Braba demais ❤
This is the best super Bowl performance
"I dont know why its not working."
Top 3 best Halftimes ever legit
It’s amazing she did this pregnant!! Woow 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I love all her songs❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
deusa
illuminati 🔺️
Мне кажется это одно из лучших выступлений на Super Bowl. Абсолютная феерия и обворожительная Рианна, будучи беременной, зажгла вновь огонь в груди своими хитами. Великолепная работа!
Why did I watch this at the age of 8 and at night
At first I found this performance very mid and lack luster but now it all looks great but I have to say the real star of the show were the back up dancers and the production design. I have seen Rihanna perform way better than that but since she's pregnant while performing I'll take whats given.

Rhinana is pregnant
As a hindu person I have put pictures of Rhianna in my mandir (Home temple) to pray to her daily
BLACKPINK PLISSSSS
I love Rihanna, but half of the performance I hear only the backing track, which is playing very loudly. I have nothing against vocals in the background of music that is not usually sung, but why are the choruses of some songs also under the soundtrack? It gives the impression that she can't sing everything by herself...

My favorite part : Rude boy
I do not know why people consider it the worst show, people sound somewhat envious because Rihanna despite being in that state she made history because for the first time that a pregnant woman gets on an NFL stage, the show is super good, the dancers, the tremendous shots and that the cameramen made the stage,  all super good, what did you expect? Let it be launched from the top of the stadium in its state like this. this show was iconic and very good congratulations Rihanna.
🎉🎉🎉
I watch this every single day
חולה חולה אלייך אני וחברה שלי אני מאוהבתתתתת ❤️

Shes not doing anything, why the big deal? Shes barely even singing. Terrible outfit, just advertising that shes preggos again. Big deal. She really needs to get over herself.
Beautiful song beautiful wonderful fabulous fantastic wonderful voice Rihanna congratulations you are beautiful Rihanna ❤ 💯
I probably gonna get hate for this but i hope people understand none of that music is hers. She doesn't write music its bought from real artists by her management.
The illuminati symbol guys
Nao sei fala inglês mais ela  de parabéns ❤❤❤
Waooo
Epic ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The band deserved more air time for sure!
I know it's late but I'm just now seeing this. Everybody kept saying how ratchet this performance was and I beg to differ cuz to me it's just whatever
Genial Riri ❤👏
Este sera el espectáculo mas visto en unos meses y tomará su sana distancia de los demas🔥
I love Rihanna ❤️, she's absolutely amazing.x
She killed this period and the choreography was absolute fire. It’s no easy feat breathing the more advanced your pregnancy is, let alone to own a superbowl halftime show.

Is everyone just going to ignore the fact she's the voice of TIP from home and all.her back up  dancers look like baby gorgs
Просто самая лучшая❤
❤
So seriously no one is talking about the illuminaty sign she raised at the End of her Performance??!!
Always fighting the current
I love how he goes all in on the owners and chefs but always stays respectful towards the waits
Cant stop watching at her ❤❤
6:11-6:15 I’m obsessed it’s giving me matrix vibes for some reason 
The dance, sounds, change in music
It was truly her moment to shine ❤
I know Rihanna is amazing and has a lot of fans, but I think this artist has been overrated for years. She was never the best live singer and she is not a special dancer either. On the other hand, there are many more talented artists who never got the success and fame they deserved, which is a shame and not fair. Shobiz was never fair.
😭🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰
ท
Idola ku❤❤❤
Əəəəə bu ne mahnıdı

Should call it the "half-assed show" most of it was pre recorded, and the actual musicians were not hardly even shown, what a pathetic joke.
I am your big fan, Love your Fabulous Voice ❤🥰😘
I love this ❤️❤️😍
Best moment at 2023❤
Would have been much more memorable, if the playoffs weren't rigged that season.
La amo no me canso de verlo ❤

Eu nunca vou esquecer quando a Rihanna tocou funk no super bowl pro mundo todo ouvir
this synchronization omggg
the pest performance ever!!
ICONIC SHE IS QUEEN RIRI and 8:20 the make up promotion was genius just because of that second was a free advert for her Fenty Beauty  brand to over 208 million people and her brand had a free advert for it so she didn't pay for it infact the Superbowl doesn't pay for the half time performers its mainly for the attention for the performer and this was huge she made brand made around $88.3 million  just for because of that one second.
Riri gorgeous queen 👑✨️
Shine bright like a diamond -Rihanna. Love you Rihanna

It was okay ig
Am I the only one who finds it hilarious that she did the Illuminati hand signal at the end of her performance? It feels like a big middle finger to people who think she’s part of it lol

Recuerdo a Shakira con un sólo traje y haciendo magia.  Después Jl con todo lo que podía desnudarse.  Ni Shakira ni Riana nesecitan nada.  Ya son reinas y que el resto la fume 🎉🎉🎉🎉
After watching all the behind the scenes of Paris and all the dancers practicing the choreography I really wish they weren't ALL dressed totally covered the whole time you didn't see even a fraction of the movements and amazing muscle movements they were doing under all those clothes
ICONIC BABY
Great show ! But uh.   I think. Coldplay and Beyoncé and Mars is the best in history
I am Japanese.
When I saw her halftime show, I was so moved by it that I couldn't stop crying.😂❤
Hai Riri ! Să cucerești Planeta cu bunătatea și talentul tău!
Did she do the illuminati sign at the end
how proud to be real women who can pregnant and dancing and sing and do whatever she wants! #amazinginspiration <3

5:19 I’ll never forget seeing him crawl after her for the first time. I’ve NEVER made a stank face the way I did seeing this for the first time. I was losing my mind at how dope the entire choreo was and how hard the dancers were hitting every move.
The dancers did the DAMN THING. They ate this choreo ALL THE WAY UP. 😌👏🏽👏🏽
Diosmio, no puedo dejar de verlooooo
❤❤

If a popstar standing high on a platform singing beautifully and dancing terrifically while carrying a baby isnt enough, the game was nice too.

Вы должны понимать - 80% магии - это танцоры и постановка номера
Вся магия исчезла, когда она в конце изобразила масонский знак,
ela sabe que venceu
I love you
Failed society

Alguien me puede exolicar que dice de fondo a partir del minuto 2:07?
o final perfeito! que linda!!
Queen Rihanna❤
Super ball😍
I have watched this literally 100 times by now and still not bored of it. The cheering and applause shown by the audience is amazing and a testament of how much she is loved. That applause at the end was epic. Definitely one of the best HT shows in history, up there with Prince, Michael Jackson, and even the Rolling Stones!
PERFORMANCES OF THE YEAR!! 🔥🔥 
Rihanna's baby inside 🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️
Used that words "kamikaze" 😭 American stupid
Amo isso 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
My pashmes 😱😱😍😍😍😍😍
CASH 💰
Linda ❤
Wow. Such an unbelievable amount of LOVE time effort of all contributed to this Show. Also of those, worked on the background.
Respect. Really Iconic.
Thank you for this Energy. Love from Germany❤
WHAT A COMEBACK?? I regret not watching this sooner. She lit that stage on 🔥 and so did all the dancers. Got chills fr
😮
that baby may have turned to mushy peas
Это лучшее выступление за все время существования данного мероприятия. Её энергетика передаётся даже через экран телефона
Imagine Cris Brown doing the Halftime Show next year ..
Why to ruin Santana?
Это было круто!
I can't believe this is less than 15 minutes. I get so mesmerized by her everytime i've watched this 😳
When you suck so bad at music you put on a ridiculous theatrical like this.
I remember when the Super Bowl show was good..
Красотка вообще ,с таким животом ,такое делать ,ну просто супер .💯
❤❤❤❤
FENTY BOWL ON DA RUN
rihanna ate ths performance
I wish I could understand the whole triangle thing that a lot of artists do. Bc if illuminati it's not real, then why the symbol? So weird, I can only relate to peace and love, hangloose, ok, f. u, loser etc
I literally watch this everyday , it’s to good.
Her music has so much feel and emotion!!!
Love u nana
This is my girl 

My girl
Rewatched
I was actually waiting for the rain.. hahahahha
Rihanna's baby is probably the youngest person to perform in a halftime show I love Rihanna on and on for I could never get bored of her halftime show this halftime show really means a lot to me because I love Rihanna and her baby ASAP Rocky and her current child
I loved her performance!! Anyone who says mean things about her is jealous! I loved the choreography and dancers! A far cry from the girl that was physically abused by chris brown!!! Intelligent, creative, strong and beautiful woman she grew up to be! She DESERVES all good and wonderful things now and in the future!! Overcome and conquer, little Queen ❤
MASTERPIECE!
I love how consistent and yet so different every episode is:
Rihana you are very beatiful
🔥⚡🤩Awesome Performance🤩⚡🔥

Pay me what you want it don’t act like you forgot it like blah blah blah call you Shasha Shasha
idk but I feel nostalgic to this performance I watch everyday
Well I felt she wasn't safe at the end. That floor was wobbling 😳😮 why put a pregnant woman that high up where it looks so unsafe? Had me shook 👀
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤
What is that triangle at the end?
Te amo
מהמם מושלם❤

That drummer kills it!
Pra mim a melhor continua sendo da Katy Perry mas a Rihanna🙌
É a apresentação mais simples de um Superbowl, e msm assim se tornou uns dos melhores de todos os tempos. Amo de mais essa apresentação ❤
Hastayım bu kadına
Rihanna is a QUEEN.
Класс ❤
Watching this from India. It has been appearing in my shorts feed for a couple of days. [4:18 Rude Boy] First, from the 30 seconds clip, I found it quite obscene. Then it started to feel less so. I watched the entire performance and it was a spectacle. Not just the art but engineering as well. We can only imagine how much planning and orchestration went into this event. And Rhianna is pregnant while performing this. What confidence and courage she is exuding. This is something that makes the USA a leading soft-power.
Qué loco pensar que dentro de unos años ésta tecnología nos va a parecer "antigua"!!!!
amazing cool the best
Why isn’t these remixes on Spotify? I would’ve listened to it all day everyday❤️❤️😂
Bengek gua 😭😭
I just fill good to see this ☺️😊😭😭😭
Too much playback, 1 year after the stunning performance by Dre this is a shame.
Brabo demais mano ,as coreografias então SLK 👌❤
goosebumps. Iconic, love all the songs, especially the last one, was waiting for that.. "bright like a diamond" title describe you well. Visual, charisma, performance.. everything on point. Love terukkss ❤️❤️❤️
SUPERSTAR LIKE NO OTHER
bom demais!!  -  too good!
I DO NOT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SUPER BOWL PERFORMANCES EVER.
Eu simplesmente amo essa apresentação tá tudo perfeito, Rihanna nem se fale, os dançarinos todos perfeitos, a roupa e a coreografia tbm, tô encantada por esses dançarinos e essa coreo, assisto todos os dias, não me canso, Riri voltou com tudo viu, perfeita ❤️
Waw it brought me to tears, this performance is amazing ✨ without being too much, just perfect! knowing she couldn't jump and stuff like this. Just perfect, perfect as Riri
Só faltou SeM
Amazing....
OMGGGGG I

When you run outta dance moves by the time you get to the song "poor-it-up"... 😂😂😂   still Epic to watch tho...😂😂
Que mulher incrível ..........
I’m so
Un solo comentario en español despues todos en ingles no entiendo nada 😢😢
Riahanna es hermosa la amo
I still wonder what was going on in the minds of the background dancers lmao
kinda rude for them to have a football game in the middle of a rihanna concert…
Unfortunately for Rihanna, she is with the Freemasons..
Best performance I’ve ever saw. She look amazing and has come so far she deserves everything. She had me in tears it was moving to see her so happy
Is she pregnant
💕🥹🤤
https://youtube.com/shorts/t0HbtVasg1g?feature=share

😍😍😍
👍👍👍👍👍
I wish Drake came out during Work, then Kanye came out during All of the Lights and went off! Then Jay Z joined them to do Run This Town, then as Kanye exits, Jay Z does the opening to Umbrella. Imagine that!! I still liked it anyway ❤ I've always been a huge fan of Ms. Robyn Fenty
красивая Рианна Хочется слушать каждый дент🥰🥰😍❤
Rihanna just slays. GO Rihanna always cheering on you
Damn rihanna best performance Eva Choreo is soo fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥

The fact that she did this whole thing while pregnant is definitely an impressive feat.
Rihanna meilleure chanteuse du monde
Amoooooooo
Te amoooooo
4:34
Where all the old heads who want Metallica or Aerosmith to perform the halftime show? No one wants to see a bunch of senior citizens trying desperately to relive their glory days 🤣 that’s why you’ll never see them on this stage at this time 🤣
virou minha rotina😅
O que a NFL tá esperando pra fazer um show do super bowl com a Kylie?
Los bailarines definitivamente fueron el añadido necesario para el impacto de ésta presentación. La verdad que Goebel Parris es una genia del baile.
amazing
Disappointing
سوت علامة الماسونية عيني عينك

That performance was lit those dancers were off the chain, Rihanna did her thing😊😊😊❤❤❤
For those of yall saying she's lip syncing i agree but she's only lip singing for certain parts that are hard, remember she's a pregnant woman and she's not young she's overworked, she's breathing for two and those of yall bashing her for lip syncing yall should check yall selves because she's barely lip syncing also if you notice she's belting which also indicates that's she's singing live and if you really pay attention and watch her veins in her neck you'd realize that she's singing live, but for majority of the parts she rely on the backup singers and backup sounds because she's out of breath at certain points and she needs a break. Also those of yall bashing her for not dancing like yall wanted or she barely moving, guys remember the lady is pregnant and she cant be moving that much she's tired she's been rehearsing and getting her body in shape her heart is pumping for 2 literally her body is doing everything for 2. I really think she did her best and it was an amazing performance yes the NFL used her original sound on the edits because that's their job but there are unedited versions and they all sound great, so leave this woman alone and be happy for her.
This Mashup is really cool
4:18 that popular part✨💗
Love  you  rihanna😝😘😚🦄💞🥳💕💞💓💗💖💯👏

This video makes me happy :)
the dancers and the choreography . we already know Riri's the bomb 
I'm waiting for someone to say i'm  jealous 😂😂
I feel sorry for those ppl who are so greedy, that theire kids must live life without...childhood. And yet seeing theire parents acting childish in front of whole world
One of the best shows, Rihanna is a true artist and as a dancer I participated in this I can say that it was a great challenge and the work of each person was too beautiful. Rihanna is amazing
Sht.... playback and someone oay for this fake sht? She made show with dancers for yall sheaps. Insult and mockin of yall americans...you were paying Suoer B. so she could make advertise her make up and using pregnancy to make promotion. In meanwhile touchin her crutch. American way, like they list selfrespect
she is absolutely incredible😍😍😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤
8:21 ladies !!! Most talented woman & entrepreneur .

Don't ever stop
I love you girl
LO MAXIMO
Símbolo satânico
Los. Bailarines parecen los upa lumpas todos los veo iguales 😊
Rihanna did so well and I love those backup dancers. They bring so much attitude, sass and joy through their moves, facial expressions and outfits, too. Great performance!
It seems Rihanna has moved on to a different chapter in her life and I couldn't be happier for her. Must be hard to do what's best for you when everyone expects sth of you. Glad she keeps doing what serves her the most!
Love Rihanna loveee

Súper bowl 2024 #Daddy Yankee.
I love her she did all that when she was pregnant ❤☺
Rihanna trying to Remind us all that she has made a lot of hits to sustain us and we need to calm down for R9 album .
Rihana is the best ❤
I see... Goddess of fertility and success. The beauty of art. Love you Rihanna for showing us the splendor of Venus

Omg yes
ありがとうございます❤

I would always turn the radio down until lift me up came on then I turned it on blast and now that I know who sang it, I realized I have been a Rihanna fan all 12 years of my life because I love the song work and wild thoughts. I loved all the songs but not going to lie, the just dance people made Rihanna look white in "where have you been."

I LOVE RIHANNA WHEN SHE WAS ON THE NFL SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW
Trump said she had no talent😠 He’s (Allegedly) jealous cuz she made he money honestly and keeps it as well. She is a billionaire!!!!❤
Rihanna looks happy not for the all these numbers of audiences but for her pregnancy 😂
Now days in comparing with music today realizing how great she is
Diva❤
Finalmente 🔥
Whats with triangle in the end 🤔
The dancers tho
All while pregnant, that's amazing.
Is she lip sinking
😮
Ur fit
I love u Riri
Are we just going to ignore that she full on did the illuminati sign at the end!?!? Repent guys Jesus Christ is coming back.
My fellow bajan! she is a LENGEND and she make us BAJANS PROUD!!🥰

Could you imagine being that baby. Not even born and on a superbowl halftime,
Inside rihanna… what a crazy life
Ucl theme song better than this halftime show
it was so great i proud her:)
I love how I know all the words too 90% of these songs! And I’ve only ever owned Rihanna second album.
Rihanna second album was one of the first I ever bought! This has totally reawakened my young inner Rihanna fan girl. I’ve always appreciated her but I feel like this Super Bowl sparked a Rihanna Rene’s dance in me.
Я вообще не пойму, как можно так танцевать синхронно ? Сто раз уже просмотрела
It's was so amazing seeing Rihanna singing at the super bowl love it ❤❤❤❤❤
Can any professional dancers answer this please? How do you guys dance so hard for so long?
I like your song
Hi
Она невероятная!

Very cool like a diamond
After the lavish K-pop party, this concert comes after it with its majesty✨💘💜
And people say Rihanna can't sing💀
I love her so much ❤❤

Åmzing😘😘😘😘

search God

She with the devil
The dancers were amaaaaaaazing, such a great job. To be able, to control their body that easily is really strong. Looking up to them! Another thing is- they are in tune from the first minute on- and that all the time. There is not even one dancer, who is being “noticeable” in a negative way.  It makes me speechless actually, such good dancers. 

The costumes are heavy anyway and I could imagine, that they started to sweat after a few scenes already. And I don’t think, that they alternate with other dancers, right?
The biggest respect. Pay some big attention to them, guys! 

I don’t need to talk about Rihanna, she is and will stay perfect.❤️
Another million years I’m still here right at the top with my new queen
So much respect and love for this incredibly talented lady
Op
Minha diva
Open ur eyes, u are worshipping a devil worshipper, she did the sign of illuminati at the End, they really exist and they don't hyde anymore. BE BLESSED  ❤ U can repent and come to Jesus, he is a forgiver ❤ sorry for my english yall

Does anyone know what happened to the dancer at 6:32? Were they okay?
This show made me realize how much of an impact she’s had on music in the past. Rihanna, you’re an icon of music 🔥
Please NFL no more pregnant half time shows..it's just weird and a conflict of interest
One of super bowl s finest performance Rihanna go girl
i keep coming back to rewatch this because of how iconic it is
Soooo amazing
Ok dancing Toltec paper approves
Imagine being paid to Dress like toilet paper roll😊

오늘도 나는 꿈을 꾼다 슈퍼스타를 직접 내 눈으로 보고 있는 모습을 오늘도 너무 행복한 하루다
My mom needs to dance like that to get this baby out 💀💀
Gooo Rihanna
I love you❤
Queen
Hermosisimaaaaa🎉🎉🎉❤
RIHANNA ❤😘❤😘❤👑👑👑❤️😘❤️😘❤
She the young and her baby I think 😂 to perform lol 😂😂
I still get chills watching this!! Absolutely STUNNING
Her expressions are so cute but she starts with slang I was like what. She looks so innocent for real gyal.
Her advertisement  of fenty beauty in d middle of d concert 🙂
I'm still trying to find out what the hype is all about. Her expression is listless, costume drab, gait sluggish, selection of songs..... boring ! If the universally loved song Disturbia is NOT even showcased, then the artiste simply isn't in touch with her audience. Sorry to say, I found nothing worth watching in this performance.
Eu amo essa show amo cada detalhe, jogo de câmera, dançarinos, as roupas tanto da Rihanna quando dos dançarinos, palcos super modernos simplesmente LINDO
The best gift the baby can get is to watch this video when he grows older ❤
The baby will born an artist ✨I bet he/she is feeling the vibe.
❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
Definitely The QUEEN!!!
Riri❤
Rihanna no super bowl se tornou uma rotina pra mim, todo dia assisto 😂
usa top in the word   ❤💪
You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times.
For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. 3They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. 4They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. 5They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly.
Wow!!!!!! Amazing...👌👌👌
It's so nice that they played football at a Rihanna concert
She is definitely born for this👌❣
Это не вероятно, глаза уже мыла, а не помогло
Simplesmente funk no Superbowl 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Это прекрасно
to much Lip sync
Amazing rihanna
Favorite Halftime Show !! 🎉
At first I was like "stop now Rhianna, you are pregnant and hangin in the air." Totally gave me anxiety 😂. Then she sang Diamonds 😍 and I was like "ok don't stop now". Then it ended 😂
This was AWESOME 👏👏👏
😂❤😢😮😅😊
Tendências American
Puissant et original. On frémit comme lorsqu'on nous raconte une histoire mystérieuse une nuit d'hiver.  Le vagabond nous hante.
❤. Rihanna
Rihanna is like a backup singer for the dancers! The dancers are IT!!!
I am somali
Every day I'm here hahahah
Rihanna, you are an incredible woman.. ❤🇹🇷
Pp
Did she just smell herself?? 😅😅
🏅
Damn..... 🎉🎉🎉❤
wow amazing she is the best 😊😊😊😊👍👍👍👍
I'm surprised that she didn't play Lift me up.
Бля Риан, ну что ты мучаешь себя... Все в порядке с то
this halftime show was amazing❤️, i love her!!!
"All of the lights" has been made for this exact moment! Cannot imagine more perfect scenery 😍
Beautiful Rihanna ❤✨️  Also the choreography by Paris Goel and all the dancers made this Amazing ✨️❤️!!
Exelente mi Rihanna ❤❤por siempre diva
i was never a Rihanna fan until I heard lift me up...
SHE JUST HAD TO MAKE THE ILLUMINATI SIGN
Thought she was finna pass out
Men= we dont have to change outfits every 5 sec , or do a hardcore choreography , we just have to sing our hits. 
Rihanna = me too 😍
13:02 just focous Andrew tate is right
Now shine like a platinum 👼
This Lady damn never fail us!!! She let herself and her song rule the very show. With awesome choreo, dancers, music arrangement and stage setup. So stunning. One of the best! And lets not forget she is preggy my oh my God! Props to her deym! Iconic and legend. Salute!
Koel😂❤❤❤❤😊
Elumanti mark 😮ending
I damn near know the choreography to this. It gets better every time I watch it 🔥❤️
리한나라면 임신 중 아닐 때라도 언제든 슈퍼볼 공연 가능할텐데,
임산부도 이런 세계 최고의 무대에서 공연할 수 있다는 걸 보여주는게 멋지네요. NFL도 대단.
Rihanna, The choreography and coordination is mind blowing! 🤯 What a production! 

I don’t understand some the of choices they made with cinematography and costuming that really took away from the intricate details of this incredible work 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

I also wish they could have worked the stomps in as actual percussion! Watching the rehearsal video the synchronization and power is crazy!! 
✨❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽💀✨
Disappointment

That’s not singing 
That was just playing CD

Live over 30%?
The dancers' outfits look so cute lmaoo, like little marshmallows
if you think she sucked, go to hell she did amazing and she’s the queen. i MEAN it.
4:18 the proof that Rihanna is actually helping the brazilian global domination lol 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Pěkný no...kontinent plný vlastní vlajky , ukázky všeho nejj největší, nejlepší, nejdražší,neuzasnejsi, největší šok...
Tak tady nesmí sportovci,kteří nemají s politikou nic společného ani vylést ale tam se jede Hopa Hopa...
Rihanna a tanec celkem super až na to,že to vypadá jako těžký peklo.... prostě ukázka zase celýho kontinentu
I love Rihanna 👏❤❤
its funny cause shes pregnant
Rihanna deveria vim pra Manaus Amazonas Brasil 🎉
Iconic ❤
Beautifull voice😊❤
I LOVE YOU RI RI

Representa muito mais que aparenta Brasilll
This is not good, how did Justin Timberlake get so much crap when this is so much worse?
Parris Goebel killed it with the choreography fr🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤
The videography was excellent
A Riana e uma belicima cantora e uma das melhores do mundo
Maravilhosa
Foi um tapa na cara da Anitta , a mulher grávida totalmente vestida arrasaaaaa ❤️

I guess when you you where born to do this to sing and dance it doesn't matter  how long it's been. She rocked
There's nobody this iconic. I can't stop watching.  The choreography,  camera work and the legendary artist.
Even with being pregnant she still has her energy I saw her touch her stomach multiple times but it doesn't hurt her she did a good job and some people don't see that I have been listening to rihanna for the past 2 weeks now and she's amazing she deserves an award.
No way could I have stood on 0latforms like that whilst pregnant! She did great. ❤
bro she is suppourting the devil

Королева R-n-B❤️
I never watch the Super Bowl halftime shows, but I'm here because of Trump's stupid comments. I literally don't get why he was hating at all. This show is amazingly entertaining, and Rhianna sounds fantastic. So many fire songs. I am pregnant and fit, and I can barely walk up a large staircase while talking without losing my breath. She is so sexy, too. Dude. I don't get it at all.

Only one thought… at 4:07 when she’s dancing to ‘we found love’ she’s dancing with her arms close to her body, but the next frame(literally just a close up) her arms are spread. Continuity error!?!? Glitch in the matrix!?!? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Always you my queen 😭

🎉🎉🎉
The more you watch this, the better it gets! Its no easy feat performing 100 foot in the air whilst pregnant.  Aside from that it's one of the super bowl performance that visually will be remembered for along time. Dance choreographer is savage and off the charts!
Já assisti mais de 50 vezes ❤❤❤
Well rehanna baby made it before the lions
This was the best performance ever 🎉🎉❤
Как она мне нравится просто обожаю её ❤
Pregnant and still slayed

Vocally, Rihanna is not a great singer but she brings something different, refreshing to the table i wouldnt trade it for Mariah Carey. My opinion
Surprised she didnt perform unfaithful

She paid homage to jayz 🥲🥹🫶🏾 rock nation

Amo a Rihanna pero aló último me da entender que siempre será de los iluminatis 😞
Amazing mom

I  love you

You are the slob, how dare you speak about Trump like that. Look at her, her actions on stage what does that tell you? Provocative, not to be watched by anyone. Do you think what you say about Trump he cares.

ILOVEYOU RIHANNA I WATCHED IT MANY TIMES.. IM STILL SPEECHLESS 🥰🥰🥰 IM SO INLOVE TO ALL THE BACK UP DANCERS🥹🥹🥹
❤❤🌷👏👏👏👏👏👏
Rihanna love you Bajans rock and you definitely do

Essa rihanna é foda nao precisa de play black como muito catores quem sabe canta ao vivo e poucas ideias
Ну реально крутая Рианна. Мы всегда тебя любили ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Me encanta, no puedo dejar de verlo una y otra vez😍👌
I love your song you  were singing
Comment below God is good ❤❤✝️
❤
Remember S.O.S? Cause I do!🤩
I still can't get over this perfection. 2nd biggest Superbowl Halftime of all time. I said it at the very beginning of this year, 2023 is the year of Rihanna!!
❤
Goddamn I love her
Simplesmente ele arrumou um monte de Minions brancos 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Perfect
Wow so amazing
Wat a vibe she is
my siblings r haters but i aint
queen ri before queen bey
Riri > Beyoncé 
Just saying 😄😁
Para mim foi a melhor
Super smash brothers.
9:02 lol
Ela arrasou grávida e fez toda coreografia ....
Whole women community may take her as an example and feel so proud of her and the bravery women carry, mother of all the men, everything. Hats off to Rihanna and the unbelievably talented team. Love from India 🇮🇳
In my opinion she should have played Lift me Up and there could have been an entire Chadwick Boseman tribute
is that Banna
На самом деле где она поет последнюю песню я расплакалась
I have watched this literally 100 times by now and still not bored of it. The cheering and applause shown by the audience is amazing and a testament of how much she is loved. That applause at the end was epic. Definitely one of the best HT shows in history, up there with Prince, Michael Jackson, and even the Rolling Stones.
❤❤😝😝😝😝😝❤❤
No hard feelings😊
Omg rhiana me love youuuu❤❤❤
Whe have the best music era❤😂🎉
Rihanna Rocked it, and the floating stages with folks dancing on them, WOW,  truly amazing, and daring indeed, and it was awesome they pulled it off without zero hiccups.
Maravilhosaaaaa!!! 🥳
She is really beautiful 😍
I don't think anyone can top this. Rihanna is absolutely amazing, but whoever choreographed it took this diva and made her performance at the Superbowl untouchable. I feel bad for whomever performs next year. Lady Gaga would be the only one that might bring it. This was an absolute MIC DROP
Can imagine conversations of ppl there -- Talking about it as they drive home. "Yeah, the superbowl was good too"
Прекрасна🎉❤
😂ihhuui
2:25 are they eagals or what
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Pregnant queen❤
Eita como é a  maioral

تجنننننننن تخيل الأغنية
This is one of the most respectable half times I've seen...
The sky after this show 🤰🏻
Awww rihanna is sooooooo cool and the dancers too. So amazing
We love you Rihanna ❤❤❤
I could see the lethargic movements due to her pregnancy but the courage to perform is remarkable 😊 outstanding
Omg
Spectacular performance. I love her wit and her voice . So phenomenal ❤
Period😂
Amazing 😍😍
omg I love her 😍😍😍🥺🥺 I wish I was there performing with her I hope I can collab with rihanna one day and work with her and do partnerships clothing brands and tours together really I wish I was a celebrity 😢😢😢 to link up with other celebs and artists
Love all the remixes and dance transitions, very smooth, we were in rihanna's dance club party🎉🎉🎉
Just Lit!🔥🔥💥💥💥💥
She made history
The more I watch this, the more I love it.
How many oxygen for 1 Matt

Quien dijo que Rihanna no lo iba a lograr al final 😅 está subiendo como la espuma en vistas y próxima a alcanzar a Shakira y JLO juntas 😮
❤❤❤
These superbowl performances are 100x better than the sport itself
This is the last supperbowl halftime show my dad saw
goGirl
Vieron esos bailarines?

Alguém brasileiro?
Rihanna unica:glorioza no que faz!eu L A treiz arco iriz authentica eh verdadeira
Nice
I love you
Funny that Rihanna has enough hits that weren’t performed in this show that she could headline a whole new Super Bowl halftime show with those songs alone
Wow ❤ speechless 😶 Rihanna killed it 🥰😍😘
Just watched this for the first time I love Rihanna...I gave this a thumbs down this wasn't her best work she should have waited had the baby
It wasn't Prince, Katy Perry or Beyoncé, but considering the circumstances, very impressive.
Go ahead riri you did the damn thing baby bump and all!!!
นี่เป็นโชว์ที่อลังการที่สุดที่เคยดูมาเลยค่ะ
очень слабо не пела, не танцевала, ладно не танцевала то то беременна,  но вокал как всегда очень слабый
На самом деле она в таком положении такой концерт устроила просто ваууууу❤❤❤ я ее обожаю дай бог много здоровья тебе
Rihanna's🎉❤❤😂😊😊💋
Brilliant
I love Rihanna , What was 13:01 about common man , I still luv you badgalriri
EYYO SHE KILLIN IT
КОРОЛЕВА.

Everything's beautiful but why the triangle at the end? Conspiracy theories welcome..

Perfeita ❤
Rihanna sure has the all time fave edm songs. It doesn't gets old
woooow,, she's like a diamon
I love this
Paris Goebel and her dancers are so notorious I love all of it.
How this woman is of any example to feminism, or any other human being at all, by being violent is beyond me.

One of the best

Alguém sabe o nome da primeira música??? Please!!!!
Wonderful performance, but I am so disappointed about the fact Rihanna did the illuminati sign at the end 😢
I know many people will say she did a diamond-sign, but come on people. Be honest. This was very clear a trangle sign. That is one of the signs of the devil. 
My heart cries, because I love Rihanna so much ❤

I was so amazed during watching the whole show but at 13:04 why did she do an Illuminati sign?  Did Rihanna thank to a place which they gave the power to her?
when her baby is born and grows up it will listen their mums music😁

Que linda cansion mi hija se llama
Aqui o comentário brasileiro que estava procurando.


Mommy manda muito 🌻🙌🏼
My Riri world
ممكن تزعل أديل
Who is RIHANNA’s fan here!?
Popular opinion: Everyone agrees that RIHANNA’s visuals, charisma, concept and talent is everything!
我之前看过介绍她在超级碗的文章，还有讲她在当地租了一幢房子，一周50万美金，这让我妒恨和有些不信任文章所说，文章说她在超级碗有载入史册的表演，但搜索网络有些负面评论，甚至讲特朗普评议她的表演是史上最差中场秀。我看过认为表演很平常，所谓载入史册不知是哪个史，任何一件事要记录也都可以吧。
她的脸看起来有些吸引我，是她的种族特征、个人特征、妆容等构成的形象，可能有些新鲜，如某种妆容的女子，看多了也就那样。我曾经很多年的听闻、看文章媒体等，大量对黑人的轻视、肮脏描述，使得我对黑人的印象是他们是低白人一等、应该活的很差的，当我在美国看到有些黑人住在帐蓬里，我觉得这就是他们应该的生活，而有些黑人十分强势、生活的骄傲富裕时，我就很不舒服，是与我印象里的形象相悖的，他们凭什么过的比我好、凭什么那么强势，他们就应该过的差、就应该肮脏穷困，就有些想要把他们按压到那种差的状况中。而逐步地，我发觉那些媒体文章和人们描述的并不是事实或事实全部，黑人目前在美国地位已然是与白人相当或仅次，他们在当地生活那么多年，且可能持续抗争，地位比别的有色人种要高的样子。
同时，我发觉和猜测认为，美国黑人生活不错，某些领域的黑人大佬地位、经济状况很高，反而在白人、有色人种之上，原因有几点：1.美国黑人曾被白人奴役和之后不断抗争，他们以黑人遭受歧视作为武器，对白人形成道德绑架，白人如有亏心事般，一旦遇到与黑人问题相关的，他们可能还会退让，且别的有色人种也会类似地以白人歧视别的人种来攻击白人，有些白人可能有白人至上观点，他们揣着这个观点，而不敢声张，在这些压力下心虚而弱势起来；2.白人需要安抚黑人的政策，在大学录取、工作聘用、甚至什么政治法律的席位里，都需要安排一定名额的黑人，类似中国可能对少数民族当中的某些人的优待来让少数民族群体认为是被尊重、有发展方向的，看文章讲雷哈娜、奥普拉成为全美（或全球）收入最高的前两个女明星，这就是说她们作为黑人的收入是在白人女明星之上的，之前我看到类似的信息，包括NBA的男黑人明星收入多少、权势地位等，就很奇怪的想法，这不就跟所谓的黑人歧视论相悖了吗？我看雷哈娜表演的时候，有种代入感地从美国白人或从对黑人有歧视观点的中国人角度，觉得美国黑人看到她作为黑人，如此高级、有钱、有地位地在舞台上，他们会觉得被安抚了，也有黑人的地位是那么好的。猜想地觉得，白人因为面对黑人的心虚、被道德绑架、甚至因黑人抗争包括2020年的BLACK LIVES MATTER，在那些领域的白人甚至对黑人有歧视的有色人种，对黑人忍让、混和着畏惧，而使得那些可能心无所忌、或利用别人的这种心理的黑人，获得了更多的利益、权势。
Just imagine her baby watching this 10 years later

She is the reason we lost

Rihanna is such an OG queen ❤
Esse símbolo /\ no final diz tudo. Numa plataforma suspensa com cabos de aço e balançando ela estava lá cantando inabalável.
Wow❤
She is an inspiration to all the womens respect for you mam
I love Rihanna my auntie loved her before she passed away ❤
She got pregnant on purpose to use as an excuse as to why she can’t move.  Girl has the hits but no iconic performances. She has no drive anymore. The label cosmetic or underwear she sells now made her lose touch with the arts and the drive is no longer there sad to say bc I’ve always been a fan but this was just pure laziness. No one can tell me you have months to avoid a pregnancy but do it right on time for the most important performance of your career. She’s using that pregnancy as a crutch to have people excuse her for it “not giving!” Your pregnant riri don’t move too much bc your baby! Aha.  You know what you were doing.
Mom , dad this 1 is for you! Yall are my diamonds!
Rest in peace mom & dad... mom January 31 2019...
Dad .. April 30 2022
They were 49ers fans.
But they were not haters.  They were mature about who went to the Superbowl. 
My father was a official for the Big Sky Conference.  He could of been in the NFL.
I know I commented before but I had to comment again. 
Sorry ladies and gentlemen,  I had to,  once again.  Please forgive me. 
These 2 beautiful people are my diamonds & Rihanna did a amazing job! She was pregnant also when she preformed also.. go girl!
I hope I shine like a diamond 💎 for my parents also like they did for me!
I love them & miss them very much!
This was a mediocre, im off to cleanse my ears by watching Prince or Lady Gaga halftime show.
I love you 7:20

SHE ATE THESE
rihanna atee
The singing was good, but the overall performance sucked, that many songs and no costume change that’s pretty boring, last song she should have changed into a nice sparkling dress to acomodate the song.
Not interested. Why did this come up after BIBI, I have no idea...
wheel chair Willie
Can’t believe I know all her songs. One of the best pop artists! 🩷🩷

Can tell shes tired as well singing & dancing while dancing but she still nailed it..
Am I the only one who found this particular halftime show completely underwhelming compared to past years? Don’t get me wrong I love Rihanna and her music. This show shows her absolute legendary status as an artist, every song was an iconic song that everyone knows. However it was pretty much just her lip syncing, and having really really good back up dancers supplement everything else. That and the platforms and fireworks but past years have just went much more all out. I’m not even blaming Rihanna, she is pregnant and I applaud her for even performing in the first place. I’m more so interested in why the event planners didn’t add more “pazazz” I guess lol. Like for example, Katy Perrys amazing sets and features, she brought out Lenny Kravitz and I believe Missy Elliot and of course had those viral Shark costume guys. Lady Gagas amazing acrobatics is another great example. Oh well it seems everyone but me loved it 🤷🏽‍♀️
hi sweet mommy
🥰😍😍
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Parris Goebel's choreo was superb ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Harikasın rihannaaa❤
Carnavales de  venidor
QUEEN
I just love this performance by Rihanna and her team… having watched the others too what I love about this is the simplicity, the discipline and the accuracy with all the dancers and Rihanna, they were completely in sync with one another through out.. clearly many many hours/days/weeks rehearsing, a great relationship between them and clearly all wanting Rihanna to succeed.. for me this is by far the best Super Bowl performance! Well done
Rihanna and team, outstanding 🫶❤️💋
Gosh, this was PHENOMENAL.❤❤❤
O melhor do melhor explendido 🙅
Wheow..my heart stop everytime the stage come up..hahaha..
NOT ME WATCH THESE ALL DAY
I love this song 🎵

Perfect ... Congratulations
Bro everyone is saying that she was lip syncing…. I don’t know if she was but even if she was it was still a great performance and she was pregnant! I can’t imagine how hard that must’ve been. Lots of love to Rihanna! ❤
Amazing 👏
Honestly never get tired of watching this
She is a LEGEND
And for you ass kissing Rihanna's ass we say what we say cause y'all scared to say it it ain't all that bye
Lawd lawd we gwan say it again and we usually call the babies adorable we gonna say mmm rhana the baby ain't all that hell I called sis baby a mess baby was not that cute we keep it real two good looking make a baby together don't mean that baby gwan be all that mmm  let's put it this way since the fake comments kiss ass and I love the babies and we gonna say what we say if the baby cute we say he cute  Chile plz so everybody that disagree oo she called Rihanna baby ain't all that cas plz just cause she a celeb don't mean that baby gonna be fine get to the nitty gritty ain't all that lol aww we love the babies lol so we will not be using messed up names for him lol chaa plz
ELA ENTREGOU TUDOOOOOOOO 😍😍😍😍
singing while pregnant and very complicated because the diaphragm and several other organs are compressed by the baby so congratulations. Besides, being pregnant is like having a watermelon tied to your stomach, so it's a big weight forward so dancing in these conditions is much more complicated than you think.
So cool
I love her
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The best Super boll 🎉❤
Todos lo escuchan re bajo volumen como yo o no???
Пела просто 🔥 голос шикарный.
Hi
I want to kiss her
My heart melted🥹❤️ 
Much love.
If you’re going through it with the right person you should be able to get a hold of them and get a hold on them and ❤
ion it’s just something about when she started performing “We found love” it just hits fr 3:04 3:18

This is the first live performance I'm watching in my whole life 😊. From 04:03-04:10 I replayed it over and over. Cos there was a time where this song was to me like a healing pill. And I'm sure this is like the 30th time I'm watching this,but this is the first time I'm commenting. I'm just amazed at how it was organized and beautiful. I love when they come in for *all the lights* too and that song humm
Hamilə olaraq o Yüksəkliye Qaldırılması Halall olsun Eyag üstdə Alqışlanaçaq səhnə bravo 😊

Feeling like nowadays we just forgotten what music is. Where is music here rather promoting sexism and some idiotic moves... No charm no deep music. And people are eating it. Like seriously?
8:20 😂😂😂

I'm just keep thinking about the baby that how great the kid will feel when it will come to see this graceful and power performance of mother❤😮
Much love from Ghana
For some reason I find this soulless and boring
i hope rihanna keeps with the music, i've grown up from the 1st song, i get doesn't make her much money but hey she's good at this!!! why waste talent!!!

This was so incredible, all the different levels in the air constantly changing. The dancers were amazing, so athletic. Just an awesome display.
The dancing is so hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣 even my cousin says that🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Como es que embarazada luce tan INCREIBLEMENTE REINA. Queen Rihanna! Siempre.
Saw this tweet about a guy and his gf...the guy was like omg rihanna looks like she's pregnant so his gf was like omgg stop fat shaming her...later on RIHANNA announced she was pregnant 😂😂😂😂 karen smh
Someone commented "my tampons during my period," and now this will forever be in my mind rent-free. 😂
🌷🌷🌷😊😊😊😊
Many of us are waiting for this moment, after the great impression that we gave to many fans; For the presentation of our idol "RIHANNA" there is no doubt that she is the best, we love you. rihanna!

I'm happy your happy
Good for you
never disappointed me !!!!
Rihanna is soooo cool she did such a good job.
Some of y’all need some perspectives in your little heads and take a seat. Imagine the statement she made by doing it 100% solo, supported by only backup dancers—who were absolutely amazing but choreographed/dressed to accentuate but not distract from her. Imagine getting thrusted sky high on a slippery platform under a thousand spotlights in front of millions of pairs of eyes in the stadium and LIVE on TV. Imagine being pregnant through this all, and having not performed for 7 years. She shouldered all this and looked unbothered af, not a single sweat bead visible on camera. Music and talent aside, BALLS OF STEEL is why she’s this successful. 

Can’t help but keep revisiting this. In awe every time. Easily the best in years. SINGULAR.
Die Tänzer sind der Hammer.
9:02 6th person from our right side almost fell 💀💀💀
She basically used a fetus as an excuse to not to try. The performing artist is supposed to motivate you to groove. That’s their job. The dancers did their job. They carried. I wanna dance with them. I would’ve carried with them and had a blast. She thinks she’s influenced the kids, the kids are about to put her to sleep. Rihanna’s son-to-be is literally in this performance, carrying. Carrying for himself. Carrying by himself. Literally a fetus. And all she can do is an ankle twist. For $27 million dollars. An ankle twist.
Riri arrasa mulher !!! Seus fãs 🇧🇷 estão aqui!
T amo rihana
Chora Beyoncé

Assistindo pela milésima vez . Arrepiadaaaaaaa 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yo that thing elevating her and wobbling while she was up there made me nervous 😅
Why are people speculating that her hand-sign at the end is Illuminati and not ....what it obviously is...which is a tribute to Hov?
I love you show
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Que Sensacional... Dançarinos...
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU WATCHED THIS 😍😍??
GO RI RI and Dancers 😊🙌🏾🤰🏾❤️😍
She got hits for days 😅
Exceptionnel
13.05 illuminati !!!!!
It's magic
I wish I knew more about why they decided on those outfits for the dancers. Reminds me of marshmallows right when you mix them with Rice Krispies, and they are melting and changing shape in the bowl. 😅
One of the BEST Super Bowl’s eva
4:55
Repent, for Jesus Christ is coming again soon. It is written, Revelation 22:20 King James Version, “He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” And when he comes everyone everywhere who has ever lived shall be judged and you can only go to Heaven or Hell there is no in between. Revelation 20:12.
“And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” King James Version (KJV). If you do not have Christ then you cannot enter into Heaven because Jesus is the only way into Heaven there is no other way. 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. The devil does not want you to know about this because he is a deceiver and he is evil. A lot of people are trusting in him and are being deceived. They are doing evil, listening to demonic music giving the devil opportunities to work in their lives when they aren’t supposed to. 2 Timothy 3:5 - Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.       John 8:44 - Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. Trust in Yeshua (Jesus Christ)and not in yourselves nor in man, go to Jesus when your sad, go to Jesus when troubles arise in your lives he will not fail you. 1 Peter 5:7
“Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” King James Version (KJV) Proverbs Chapter 3
5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Repent now for there shall not always be time to. Revelation 10:5-6
“And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:” To be saved you must confess with your mouth Yeshua and believe in your heart that God raised home from the dead. Romans 10:9
“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
Best iconic incredible amazing!!!! Half time show ever!!!!
No paro de repetir la entrada de Axel, me da una energía y emoción a la  vez.  Eterno Freddy, Axel, Elton y Queen!!!
Ur show is best
First of all turn that diamond around its not like diamonds in the like deep fried pumpkin pie
Is it a boy or a girl
I lost count of how many times I came here to see RIRI <3
İts amazing
I remember when I first heard umbrella.  I told a friend that Rihanna was going to be really famous.  She didn't believe me. She hated her voice.  I said you better get used to hearing it because she's going to be around for a long time.  She was like she will fade into out.  I just laughed and said ok. 

The same thing happened when Chris brown premiered on Nickolodian. I was like this kid is going to be big. They've both exceeded my expectation
🥰🥰🥰
lk qualms
Rihanna knows her music and those danders are epic!!!! Love them.
This is not lip syncing, this woman is for real. Anyone says different can kiss my a$$.
Oh man, she's so damn beautiful. What a explosive performance. Thank you for this awesome performance.

Are the people of America completely debased in spirit? A pregnant woman shakes her seat and you applaud? What happened to you people, come to your senses.
Lemme be honest,rihhana backup dancers were one of the reasons how this blew up.
this is a moment in history nobody will ever forget
This is like the 50th time I’ve watched this, and I’m proud of it 😊❤😂

I like the unfiltered illuminate sign at the end.. classic move . (we're not part of a secrete sociaity or group).  well done.  youtube. well done apple.
4:03-4:10 I can't stop replaying that part over and over because I just am in awe of her beauty and grace of her performing and her smile while doing it. She looked like she was having the time of her life and her whole performance was such a memorable one. She looks stunning even while pregnant and it really was a fantastic show <3
Love Rihanna but the dancers were amazing ….. total talent

Magical🎉
:)
bread and circuses.
❤😮🎉
I don't know if people are really attracted to this license because it is cheap in appearance and the principles are intended to imitate the devil because it really resembles him and his devil appears to the public in more than one way, so that you have an appointment with God
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
When "Shine bright like a diamond" came i lost it man...cried idk why
NO VEJO UM BRASILEIRO

❤ sou do Brasil Rihanna e a única
Imagine how hard Rihanna would had went I’d she wasn’t pregnant
❤❤❤
The sheer amount of planning and safety measures going into a show with multiple suspended platforms, multiple fricking cable cams (that by the way sometimes interfere with the moving space of the platforms so a huuuge amount of coordination is necessary) and a pregnant super star in the middle is incomprehensible to me 😱
Hit
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Queen ❤👑
Fuxking awesome ❤
hey guys it's rhianna on superbowl!!

Me: oh i see. nice
Dancers are fire ♥️🔥🔥🔥
Si on devrait définir le mot synchro dans le dictionnaire on devrait indexé cette performance juste top et  b1 préparer

Half time show was ass do better nfl

No one noticed the one back up dancer doin' the "Her way dance" at the top🤣 at
9:01
Vanessa British
The choreography was good, especially the back up dancers. Though I get why she couldn’t dance. But what was really fun to see was all facial expressions, not just Rhianna’s but also the dancers.

No one is appreciating her hard work. Being pregnant she danced so well and that took so much of efforts for the rehearsal. She just rocked the show 😘
Lovely also good job getting this view
KYLIE MINOGUE 2024
Se quejan de que no dio espectáculo, pero ahora que la veo, estando embarazada ¿que espectáculo querían que diera? ¿Que se pusiera a dar volteretas? Bastante espectáculo dio poniendo su voz, que se muevan los bailarines que para eso están
Ole five head

1of your back up dancers where doing a TikTok dance
Lamejorcancion
9:03 the backup dancer doing a tt dance in the bg is sending me
Меня порвало на кусочки. Со мной давно такого не было. Господи.
Я разревелась. 
Я испытала мощнейшее поражение от красоты, таланта и величия людей. Какие же люди классные! Они умеют создавать такие песни, такие танцы, такие шоу!
Боже, какая Рианна невероятная! Если бы у моей души был облик - то это была бы свободная, яркая, сияющая Рианночка. Все выступление у меня подкатывали слезы, но я держалась и смотрела не дыша. 
Я разревелась на её последней песне. Шайн брайт лайк э даймонд - господи, ну как так. Ну как это возможно, что бедная грустная девочка из глухого сибирского города сидит блин слушает эту песню , смотрит на все это величие и умывается слезами, потому что внутри такой вот шайн брайт всю жизнь, а выразить не может. Ну как так, ну почемууууууу. Хочу сиять, пусть по-своему бледненько, но хочууууу😭😭😭😭 не могу перестать плакать! Рианна, ну как же так, ну зачем ты даришь мне такое мощное прозрение, которое я не в силах и не в средствах воплотить и реализовать 😭😭😭😭 так давит груз упущенного времени и возможностей. И утерянная напрочь раскрепощенность!!!!!!! Как быть, как воплотиться и во чтоооооооооо???? (риторически😭😭😭)
i've only watched this 100 times...RI RI!!!
Amazing💣
What is the title of the 08:20 song?
❤❤❤❤❤
Melhor música da Rihanna 🎉❤

Tnx God i saw comment before asking...is she pregnant... beautiful
Her voice is very beautiful ❤
WHAT IS THE MELODY?🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Respec+Respect=Respect
I don't know how many times I watched this!!!! What a masterpiece! Thank you Rihanna!!! 🎉
I couldn’t stop my tears 😢🥺🥺🥺Her voice everything so perfect she just nailed it...People remember that she made a history 🎉🎉🎉

Don't care one way or another about Rihanna, but this was incredible

The dancing is unparalleled and I'm struck by how powerful her voice is here. They used the support vocals to frame her perfectly and don't hide when she drops in and out.
The best in the world
This is a beautiful performance
Anybody see that man from wild thoughts 🤔
💙💙
Yooooooo… the ovation was real!!!!
like rihanna did it so good plus she pregnet
Rihanna the queeen!!!!

Whats with the pyramid sign at the end, dont get it.
All the entire performance was about her pregnancy and was amazing
The next is coachella and glastonbury ❤❤❤❤
É uma Diva sem dúvidas ótimas músicas mas a coreografia e palco inferior os outros intervalos do Evento de anos atrás.
RESPECT , LEGEND ❤❤❤
The Rude Boy performance sent me.
Si pudiera darle like cada vez que lo veo, lo haría. The best súper bowl of all times 👑

Pregnant immigrant black woman on stage in the superbowl. Feels a bit like the Obama innoguration.

Many familiar soundtrack of life
There's noooo need to skip 😩
ELA É A RAINHA!!
If was it or wasn't it playback, I DON'T CARE, IT'S THE RIHANNA GUYS, SHE LEFT THE COMFORT OF HER HOME AND WENT THERE TO PERFORM, It was just too nostalgic and wonderful
Ilove riri❤❤❤❤
4 :25
4:20 is my favourite
It's amazing 👏 ❤❤
Everything About This Show is just... Wow!
The dancers were amazing!!! Like in most halftime shows there are dancers but i have never seen a performance where they were such a big part of it in haltfime. Like they set the whole mood.
What a performance ❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍🙏🙏🙏
Блеющая коровка. Ничего выдающегося, просто хорошо раскрутили
Earthxiudyd😅f
People are STILL watching this performance over and over..months later. That's how bad-ass Rihanna is as a performer! Anyone who has carried a baby knows that sh#t was hard work! Kudos to you Robyn Fenty❤

Rihanna doing all of THAT while Pregnant, i wonder what would she do if she wasnt. What an INCREDIBLE artist.
Why do I feel like I'm watching oompa loompas in Willy Wonka lol, but get it girl baby's probably in there jamming. I was so scared for them on those platforms.
DAMN, Rihanna is my favorite performer forever
2022 is the best

La pyramide de l’antichriste que fait elle a la fin de la video et le rouge que tu porte on allant vert le haut c’est pas l’élévation que satan te donne réfléchi bien tu va prendre tous sa avec toi dans ta tombe et quand tu verra le dieu unique de tous l’univers c’est la ou tu sera pas rihanna mais une mexrde qui exploite les gens on vident leurs poche pour qu’il suivent la satan que tu pris avec so. Fils crée d’une humaine le samiri 
Gare a toi satan on observe et gare a tes decibles bientot on va tous les tuer un par un avec le mehdi !!

The dancers was really amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone think this is like a period in a pad?
That devil sign/illuminati sign at the end just was so forced. Why can't Hollywood just let art flow at their own why do they need to mix devil into art? Remember back when everything was normal what happened to westworld?

존나노잼 ;;; ㅅㅂ 할사람 없으면 내가 똥꼬쑈ㅠ할게 그냥
This so gd❤
Loving this❤️❤️
Hey
It’s a good performer nothing more. I will never understand her huge success. Lady Gaga is moooooore better thant her, same Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry…
The new Cells At Work looks cool! Go Red blood cell-san!!
Imagine Justin on the next year's super bowl Halftime show.

J
hi Rihanna i love your songs so bad  congrats on being a mom 🤩and i am a big fan
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
GUT. See how my internet connectivity went when that with "toes" popped up?

Toes-->feet-->UNC chapel hill logo-->Vietnam was a strategic mistake PhD thesis-->then brigadere turned to Lt general hr McMaster.

Grand unified theory? I believe Miley, Austin and Willow saw it being sabotaged last night.
See my tip here to Lisa Monaco that I said this show fits the PLA riddle and links her to DPRK. So shield my murderer so she can try and take over the racket and only prosecute competitors.
Rihanna Illuminatenorden 👁️‍🗨️
I love you baby I'll see you on the stage I love when you dance do the work song Andrew boy I love your dancers on that and your outfit oh my God you're so cute get it get it Rihanna Rihanna I love that song you say please don't stop the music
Rihanna is so cute. Rihanna got pregnant and made her plump. But damn, she looks prettier than when she was thin.

Why she performing???take some rest you are pregnant.😢😢😢
Who says giros are weak❤️❤️❤️
11:54 it's was so beautiful that she patted her baby bump right when the lyrics went- "we are like diamonds in the sky". It was like she was telling that to her baby.

I’m so glad she danced and still was making sure she was safe for her and her baby. This performance was phenomenal
What  I mean  about  cool  is  the  NFL  HAD A BARN BURN😅
Very  cool 🎉
Me quedo sorprendida porque a pesar de estar embarazada lo hizo espectacular y les diré porque , en tiktok y demás redes sociales miles de chicas imitan este baile y no están embarazadas , es increíble que Ri se ve mil veces mas bella y el baile sin duda nadie la supera 🎉 ahí es donde te das cuenta ella tiene algo brillo nato
Te amo Rihanna ❤
Coming  for 150 million in less than a month ❤
Love it!

The royal family dance crew is legit the best dance crew I've ever seen. Those dancers and Paris choreography was awesome.

Pretty bad halftime show
Que linda a minha esposa grávida se apresentando no Super Bowl!!! 👏🏻😍😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Idgaf what anyone says I absolutely loved every minute of this
Super Bowl 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Rhianna
All those people following her around while she was dancing I feel like would have made me feel so powerful or paranoid
Your my forever beutiful rihanna!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤ U forever Rihanna❤
I love You 💕 💜 ♥️ 💖 ❤️ riri
I love how the dance is pregnant-friendly. Rihanna moves less yet moves the crowd. Kudos 🤗

Also, the dance choreographer also kept an act during "Pour It Up" where she gets to sit after those 7 minutes of standing.
Extraordinary performance i had viewed more than 20 times in the month
Me encantan sus canciones diis la bendiga soy tu amiradora  eres canta lindo
Rihanna ate
that kid is never gonna hear the end of this story
What a historical show. It bring us how the limit of human beings is!
O óvulo e os espermatozoides gente achei conceito 😅
Nunca vou cansar de dizer o quanto ELA É A MAIORAL. Te amo, Robyyyyyn
🎉Magnific
Did anyone else see her do the Illuminati symbol at the end of her performance? The triangle shape she made with her hand. Seems a little off to me

i'm so happy for your baby and you did so so good
Congratulations that your pregnant I'm so happy for u😇😇😇
I wish she had done one wardrobe change but other than that loved it.
Amooooo
I love u ❤
She is iluminate

O muleque teve o dom de fazer o funk tocar em pleno superbowl, isso foi foda !!
Have you seen the Masonic sign that made... 🤯?
At the time 9:03 the 5th one I think you see them doing her way! You will thank me later.
13:02 you KILLED BADGALRIRI
THIS IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE SUPER BOWL PERFORMANCE!
bro what was that last sign for. 🤯
Mike rihanna is a vibe
Get some good music like the Captain and Tenile or Ricardo Montabon...
@mike coady
Hey mike
But hess
Hh
O
Incredible performance! WOW 🤩😍
One of the best Super Bowl
I wished Tom Holland was her guest artist... 😞
What is this music ??
Imagine someone was afraid of height
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Rihanna is the best especially the song that is called work work that is very amazing 🎉🎉🎉
Work of art, talent, and best NFL Halftime show in history. And thats on periodt.
wow
Рианна пристегнуть, а танцоры нет, но если близко наводят камеру, то видно что эти летающие платы качаются.
платформа еще и ходит,а она с бебиком внутри...пипец она рисковая.у меня голова закружилась,а она на такой высоте висела- я не могу просто стоять даже за перилами на такой высоте,меня прям реально парализует,а она пританцовывает на высоте нескольких метров..вот что значит профи
I wonder if Rihanna wanted The Chiefs to win or the Eagles
Reina
My daily visit, I never get bored

My favourite singer ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She’s pregnant ??😊😊
ela vendeu a alma
I’m stupid
Hola
nobody talks about her showing the illuminati triangle at the end-? i know i know, she just made a simple diamond bc of the song but whz she didnt show some other sign at previous songs?
She is amazing
Танцоры это супер
Te amoooooooo, te amoooooooooooo🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I live in az and like 15 min from the stadium 😭and I was at target when she was preforming sad I missed it but the fireworks scared me💀
Rihanna can carry halftime all by herself, but in terms of production value and performance energy, choreography, and overall impact, it's hard to beat Madonna and Katy Perry's halftime. Their show was just epic. Not even Lady Gaga came close.
CARIBBEAN  QUEEN  RUN THE WORLD..REPRESENTING!!!! TRUE INSPIRATION!! YOU'RE  WELL LOVED...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!!🇩🇲🇩🇲🇩🇲🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧

You know you legend when you have to skip some hits out of your set list 🤣🤣
This was really fun to watch! 
The scale of this performance was applauding and magical. 
The flying stages looked so cool and especially in the middle of so many people at such a huge place with all the fireworks. 
The outfits of the Dancers and Rihanna went really well together and loved how new the moves were.
Overall this is what I call a great performance which keeps you hooked till the end! 😏😙👍

This honestly felt like her concert! 😂
Nice Rihanna.Come in Kenya to bafrom

Amazing 😍❤️
https://youtu.be/YjCg5C6z_zA
Great performance, but nobody gonna talk about that symbol she made with her hands at the end? 🤨
❤
Rihana never failed to impress me. This is too good to watch like watching it once is not enough...
Is this dua lipa’s previous choreographer??

That was an incredible performance from the superstar Rihanna... i cant stop watching her perform despite a long time on stage.  indeed, she is still the G.O.A.T.
❤❤❤❤Soo...Good!!!
❤😊
Rihanna didn’t preform in a football the football game played in her show
🤩💘
Rihanna is Queen of Qeen music
Rihanna
THEY. DID. THEIR. THAAAANG!!! 🥰 Dancers were absolutely unbelievable!!! Ma’ props to all of y’all! Loved the entire performance! My fav part, though, was when the camera was going down the runway, during “Rude Boy”, and each small group of dancers did something different and showed their own personality to the camera!
the best part for me is she looks like she was genuinely enjoying herself
without a doubt the best super bowl since Michael Jackson and Madonna. It was natural, spontaneous, technological, I have never seen an artist enjoy singing like Rihanna. We love you RiRi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5cx6bXb90&t=243s
La reyna!
People are so crazy , have such high expectations they want superhuman performances . Enjoy , the woman is amazing , came and killed it. This is not underwhelming at all.
my friend, classmates and family said they didn't really like the half time show like some of them hated it and said it sucked but i loved it!
Let the man live already.. He snitched for a reason I woulda done the same thing aswell too my "ppl" 🤷‍♂️
🎉🎉🎉❤❤
You go on stage, then you climb to a height that is not normal 😮😮😮😮😮😮and you sing and dance at the same time, it's crazy😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅, but it's obvious that you like your job❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and the baby, and you yourself can get hurt during your performance🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉...that's a lot of courage🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The mashmellow suits had me squeeling like a pig. They look so stupid. What was the thinking behind this? Who sat down and was like yeah marshmellow suits will look so hip and cool? What?
الولد شو وضعو😂😂😂😂😂

Hzz  KB $&$:83❤😂🎉🎉😢😅😅😊😊
The whole fact that most ppl would be out of breath singing for 3-4 min and then there’s just this iconic queen (Rihanna) singing onstage whilst being pregnant not to MENTION DANCING



This is no ordinary celebrity we all know 









Hats of to her!🎉
❤❤❤
Uau que showwww! Diva demais!
God I can't imagine dancing on those things. Every step would make the suspended platform sway from the wires.
Not my style of music, but this presentation was perfect 😅Thanks DJ Klean to come here to enjoy the master piece 🤘🏼
the baby got first class
Non si può competere con lei❤
Perfeita 😻😻😻😻
Eu te amo Rihanna 💘😻😻💙✨
Probably the 100th time I watched this and I love it more and more each time ❤

Hi
YOU  ARE  GOOD 😍😍😍😍😍🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Mmm
لن تصبحي بيونسيه 🦦
My god she still singing ? Make this suckage stop my ears are bleeding
What a PHENOMENAL performance! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 The whole performance was in sync, not a beat missed. And she sounds exactly like her record , if not better! Not once did she look tired or out of breath, super props to her. Bc I would have been worn out honey. She performance amazingly. I hope she has an effortless birth like she did on this performance. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯
Всё идеально: Танцы, песни, съемка... Это я понимаю профессионалы - отрабатывают свой гонорар кровью и потом... Не то что наши звезды, которые просто стоят на сцене под свою фанеру...
❤
❤❤❤
She killed  it
Esses bailarinos perfeitos! Que incrível!
DAMN!!!!!!! she ate it and left no crumbs.🔥🔥🔥🔥
Women Empowerment !!!!!!!!
I mean people saying this wouldn't had been the same without the dancer but the dancer wouldnt be up there without RIHANNA music. And the choreography was inspired moves since day 1. You wont see moves like this anywhere cuz those are rihanna-esque.
Pra mim foi o melhor show do Superboll ❤❤
i just can't get over
I wish I could like this video more than once😭❤🔥
Old is always gold like our childhoods life 😔💘❤ My eyes filled with full of tears when We found in love music started🤧
Nice

Wow.... Ang galing galing😊😊😊😊
2:23😍😍😍
👍😘☘
Todo dia eu ouço, viciei ❤❤
Juste comme ça 😘. On adore tous rihanna . bisous à toi
This performance is PHENOMENAL in my humble opinion. And while there is obvious back tracking (duh, she doesn't try to hide that and I don't know of a performer today who doesn't use any), SHE IS NOT LIP SYNCHING. I have watched this quite a few times. It is SO good. I love the simplicity of the set, yet the HEIGHT /  platforms.  The entire crew was so well prepared. I always 'liked' her music, however, the more I watch this, THE MORE I LOVE HER.
The dancers looks like bunch of bunnies 😅
Não prometeu nada e ofereceu tudo, amei me apaixonei
She is so young and so amazing… her eyes are so innocent.
❤❤
🇵🇱❤️💪👍Super 👍💪❤️🇵🇱

Rude boy❤💥
O Brasil virando referencia na musica mundial
Um espetáculo
Is she pregnant?
4:51 ayo no way she did the infamous ‘scratch and sniff’
No body sings like you RHNa
The fact that Rihanna still decide to perform while she was pregnant
C’était « ok » pour la musique mais, côté danse, RIHANNA aurait pu essayer d’en faire un peu plus🤔🤨😤😕J’ai visionnée l’autre vidéo, celle avec la fille qui fait « le show «  de RiRi en language des signes.🥹🫡🫠🤯 C’était carrément .. WoW ⁉️‼️sérieux… La fille devait non-seulement être douée pour son travail MAIS devait savoir le répertoire de Rihanna et, le plus important ; elle devait posséder le GROOVE 😅🙃🫣🫠🤩‼️
Once a week I come back here to watch this masterpiece
I love Rihanna's songs
I love the halftime show!!!! 🎉
❤❤🎉😊😊😊😮
❤❤🎉😊😊😊😮
❤❤❤
You never notice until yk this are men

Sorry, but not sorry, Rhianna, but you can't beat last year's halftime show. 

Not by a long shot.

What an iconic and outstanding performance! Rihanna is a gem.

Damn I love this woman
I am no longer her fan
She did the sign
Did she just sniff somewhere
hold on.........did they edit the video???? the camera movements are more dynamic than i remembered it
She is giving the illuminati sign at the end of her performance
She's a legend.  Her voice is incredible.  Her discography slays. This was my favorite Half Time

Love her
Who came here to see Nuno play guitar give a like 😆, I end up actually enjoying the singer performance
Foi recorde de audiência na TV,   vai ser recorde da Nfl no YouTube
Rihanna and everyone did an amazing job
the camera man is insaneee
I watched this video 200 times already I know ever dance every song every beat
It definitely was a Rihanna’s concert interrupted by a super bow game.
I came here as a dude, trying to understand why this song was so loved by the womenz......  I saw them open for U2 and they sounded horrible, but bae's were into it...and whenever it comes on at wedding receptions...  "Oh ma Gaaawd!!" And up they go to dance....   I don't get it.
hi
Amazing show 👏❤🙌😍
and to the guy who's talking sh🖕t about her performance. man your just jealous and so f🖕king insecure because you've been in the industry yet you haven't step in that stage 🤭🤭🤭shame on you.
Uuuuu
I loved it
Rude boy ---->.    4:17
Is she pregnant 🧐
Love her music. Just wasn’t crazy about the dancing. But I can say, she was having a great time. That’s what truly matters. You can tell by the smile on her face.
Best halftime show hands down!
i love the fact that she was prob like "yall better give me a hot mic or i'm out." she's here. she's an icon, and we all love her. even though i do love rihanna, this performance really did NOT disappoint and anyone who says it did is lying.
Literally all the white sells fighting off one blood clout.
Yo solo vine para escuchar la canción del inicio a es la q uso Blackpink en su predebut con Idols
Rihanna: where have you been all my life

Hey dâu, dấu dâu 😂😂😂
The fact that she did all this with ...... ..damn🔥🔥🔥
only good in one video she sings too well she is too beautiful
Where you been
🇧🇷👏👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍😍
Rihanna's baby is probably the youngest person to ever perform at the Superbowl Halftime Show! Props to mom & baby
NFL you need to convince her for another half time performance. I don’t know how your going to do it but pleas do it 🙏🏼
Inefável. I love you, Riri. Forever ❤
The biggest star to come out of the West Indies.
I just love Rihanna. Amazing performance, I have watched more than 10times. My husband always say she is beyond Beyonce by far. ❤🎉
RIRI!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
I would have loved to see Tom Holland make an appearance during the Umbrella song 
Awesome
And I'm here again
The works half time ever
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Rihanna tu patrona 💅🏻💋
Nyimak
Rihana the female goat😂
So demonic, blasphemous, sinful, and satanic,
Does nobody realize how she put the Illuminati symbols up
Rihanna you should make a song about your baby
Sorry 😢I was not able to make it
Rihanna i am a big fan of you
Hablan muy mal de ella como persona. Pero como yo no la conozco y ni ganas de conocerla.😂 solo veo lo artista que es.
❤❤❤
Thank you Rihanna. Thank you NFL. Thank you dancers. And thank you America. You guys are all awesome 🙌
❤
I really love the addition of Run This Town and All Of The Lights to the setlist, despite Rihanna not being the main artist of these tracks.

She might be the only pop girl that successfully merged with the rap world. Rihanna's voice always felt natural and effortless on these rap tracks. I don't think that any other pop singer could have done that. And look how respected she is by these artists: Kanye West, Jay-Z, Eminem, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj all worked with her.
How many times have you seen this performance? 
-Yes
Ok, Ri, it's me)
Love you so much
Muito bom
Queen 🖤👑🤩
4:03 LOVE THAT WIGGLE WIGGLE
❤❤❤ 128million view in a month Love you Riri #riri@NFL Thank you and @ Apple Music You made us proud ❤❤❤
So many people are accusing her of lip syncing but I mean who cares she performed an amazing half time show plus she has a BABY in her so I wouldn’t blame her.
You go Rihanna
❤️🇰🇭
Was that an illuminati hand sign that she did at 13:03
Yay
8:46 Run bulletproof run, yeah, you gotta run
Song in 8:55 please
😯😯😯esto fue increíble, está mujer hermosa dio lo mejor de ella, yo no hubiera puesto en riesgo la vida de mi bebé ni la mia de esa manera, pero Rihanna es profesional. I LOVE YOU Rihanna❤❤
Great video
Slay
She did the illuminati sign at the end 🔺
Ha nvrmnd the comments answered my question
Is she pregnant?
Este super bowl me da 1000000 años de vida 🎉
Rallye its perfection every thing in the live 👍🌷

She isn't lip syncing, she's just using back up fillers to pad out her voice, and she pregnant and dancing like a boss 😎🔥 you can see the natural inflections of her voice on camera as she sings ...
The best apresentacion 🎉❤
13:04
Це Бомба!!!!
прям ностальгия нахлынула и зажегся огонь в душе, ты просто супер Rihanna!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😄😄
I am shut down!, what a POWER should she have to perform while being pregnant and with such a big belly already!
Какой же крутой концерт🔥🔥🔥
Looks j😊
Dudeee- this is totally 🔥🔥
I just wanted to say that Rihanna did an outstanding job and I hope this is a return to music! But those dancers did a fabulous job and I can tel they worked hard!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
the happiest video for me ❤❤❤
Icon
All my youth flashed before my eyes.my queen❤️
❤❤❤
I can't.  I have to give her her props . Man she did her thing despite all negative comments do you ribaby
Bài hát này hay thật đấy nhưng mình chưa tìm ra tên❤❤
Hay
This performance gives me life. I've watched it umpteenth times. ❤️😍❤️

Puurrrrr  💅🏾
wonder how much it cost her to pay for all those dancing marshmallows....
The Best super bowl
Это божественно🛐💔
Although I have not been to the Super Bowl in reality, but Rihanna's performance even through the screen causes such delight that I have goosebumps and tears in my eyes! The energy was transferred to me for the whole day! Pretty woman, and pregnancy makes you even more beautiful! Thank you for being there!
Fantastic
It is Unhealthy how many times I repeated this😂❤️
Hope the baby is fine in the belly or the baby will juggle and wiggle in the belly
Tôi rất thích thương hiệu này
You are the best singer ever!!!😍LOVE SO MUCH!!!!!🥰
A good example of a bad mother, what happened to this world!?🤮
❤❤❤
IMO this is the second best female performance for a major sporting event. 1st being Whitney Houston SB
Th e more I look at this the more I fully appreciate the total artistic performance- set placement , choreography.  Live must’ve been awesome!!! Rihanna is a vocalist!!❤❤🎉🎉
https://youtu.be/69wD9AtAa5k
En una palabra "ENCANTADORA" ❤
That's some deep illuminati symbolism right there.  White sperms swimming towards an egg scheduled to begin the cycle of leaving the body indicating the chosen one will not be born this year.  Damn. The red sea wasn't parted, the flow, the rag, the period couldn't be stopped.  Mary still gives the orders.
Great! Vest wishes from blind artist in Hollywood!
OMG I can't stop watching this superbowl, Riri the best!
I love Rihanna.
Love from Bangladesh🇧🇩🇧🇩

I love her perform

Love Rihanna ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song❤❤
i love you rihanna❤❤❤❤
If only she wasn’t pregnant, her performance would’ve been more dope
The fact that so many of her songs are more then 10 years old and everyone still can't get enough of them that's how much of an icon she is
Being totally honest Rhianna can sing ,perform,, Mother, businesswon......the list is endless to her accomplishment.For Bethany Frankle to online bully her says a lot about her character, jealousy, intimidation. Prayers sent Rhianna keep slaying beautiful lady.🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
3. For sho
is perfectttt
She needs to retire and sit her no talent ass down and stop putting out her crappy music once and for all
Rihanna is the first pregnant woman ever performed for Super Bowl
But the dancers in white look so adorable Cuddle-able   and cute 😫
Это просто невероятно, я занимаюсь танцами восемь лет, но нигде ещё не видела настолько классного исполнения❤
รักนางสมกับการรอค่อย❤❤❤❤❤
Parris goebel is always on point!!!
Good
Rihanna in dress will look much more harmony land beautiful with her beautiful woman voice.
Que mulher maravilhosa ❤

Do not worship this Satanist who made the new world order symbol at the end of the performance. They have no christ in their DNA, they can't acend to God wake up cos we can so they lower our FREQUENCIES. They traumatise us through out history with a survivor hierarchy. She is a puppet for Satan. Learn how energy works!!!!! Vibrations, frequencies and energy will unlock the universe- tesla
I wanna go there 😢
04:18 Essa parte é uma das melhores.

Рианна - выглядит как Королева, двигается как Королева, смотрит на зрителей как Королева, потому что она и есть Королева! 👑😍❤️ Так держать, красотка! Не знаю, уже сколько раз пересмотрела это выступление - удовольствие и мурашки! 🥰

What a superstar with always excellent  & spectacular presentation at super bowl halftime ,as the artist singer and producer .Sending you blessings to you for health first and foremost your baby. big congratulations that I know are so much more to come. 
Love Jrod❤
Trust me, this will go down as one of the most iconic halftime show over time. 

People usually love to critic Rihanna at first just for her to always end up winning. When she released ANTI, critics and listeners hated it and regretted the lack of hit-worthy songs. Seven years later, the album is still charting on the BB200 and will soon have 3 Diamond certified singles.

This halftime show is definitely different than other shows but it remains true to Rihanna. No over-the-top stage design and production. Just a performance that people can relate to. And that's why it's so successful, viral and will definitely be among the most watched halftime shows on YouTube.
The fact that it's been a month only and this video has racked up 175 million views. She's already beat Katy, lady Gaga, Coldplay, Madonna, and so many more. And ppl had the audacity to say this performance was bad!!!
*Vamos subir essas visualizações glr*
This is hilarious

Rhianna’s kid is gonna look at this one day and realize that they were the youngest person to ever perform.
I think she meant to say thank you planet Earth
13:03
Foi o melhor Superbowl até hoje sem dúvidas ,  Rihanna é impressionante só tem hits,  agora queremos Britney Spears, seria épico.
Foda demais !! Te amo Rhi❤
When it comes to cooking Gordon is an absolute expert at roasting literally anyone for the flaws in their approach to it
She gave her all
I was never a huge Rihanna fan. But this resparked my respect for her. That was not an easy performance for her to do, after taking a few years from singing, AND also being pregnant, AND also all that rehearsal, WHILE BEING PREGNANT. And she also probably was busy trying to also run a beauty company. 

HUGE HUGE HUGE RESPECT.
Today only best I love you more much miss you miss you oaky and funny cool keep or there see you 💕💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😍😍😍😍🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
"S L A Y"
Is Rihanna actually pregnant???
Mid halftime show
4:57
🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
A lot of movements for     pregnancy 🙏🏽
This is to prove that women can be as powerful as man, while carrying a baby and having a family.
Brasil en la presentación de Rihannaaaaaaaaaaa que buenooooooooooo <3

I Love RiRi so much. I have watched this video at least 30+ times, still watching. That baby is already a star 👏👏👏
Love you 3rd and
she got like 30 of those things following her
Вааай классные, я так понимаю это матка и сперматозоиды, все шоу про культ перевоплощения
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Riri vc mata noxxx❤
Let's admit that we all came here for the first time to see Riri perform, but watched the entire performance again for the background dancers. 
Everyone did splendid job, my personal favorite would be the guy at 4:25
Advertising is bad
Love this performance! But why is this sound so rubbish.. Even the reaction videos have better sound quality
Hey world this is what a woman is you go girl shine bright like a diamond❤
Pewdiepie and Gorgon Ramsay in one video.... I can die happy now
I loved the entire performances/ I was expecting songs like man down, hate that I love you or needed me and the monster :D But good job though <3
La mejor ❤😊
The whole thing was awesome, it was a lot of work, from one that choreographed it, the practices they must have gone thru, the dancers being that synchronized, the multiple floating stages. Her body suit under the layers looked a lot like one Britney Spears wore in a music video. I just have to  say tho I think she has a bit of a crush on herself. The scratch and sniff move,😂😂😂
I almost choked on my drink, bad timing on my part!🤷🏻‍♀️
Top👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
QUEEN IS BACK!!!!❤❤❤❤❤👑
Wow o m g
Go gurl 😍
She took the money from her sister and mom
This will be the best superbowl performance for decades ❤
rhiana number one
nice
This was INSANE
it was very nice
rihannas baby had the best seat
I love it but my friend said you are lip syncing I absolutely love you I don't no what is wrong with my friend
I’m glad to see everyone fully dressed.. no nakedness.. no inappropriateness. And as a woman who is 8 months pregnant I give my props to her bc I wouldn’t be able to do it 😂I would’ve been sitting down the entire time. I know her baby like “mom what’s going on”
At the end of her party, she noticed that the Freemasonry movement carried her hand😮
Maybe u cant love this kind of music, but her voice is incredible
When I thought super bowl
This was the super bowl👀👀👀👀
Her baby was the special guest😂🛑
It was wow, the set, the dancers, Riri perfect and most beautiful pregnant
Rihanna ate this like ❤🎉
Baby must be living the concert from inside haha 🎉 Imagine how must it sound
nice
The best show omg 😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shining voice 🎶like diamond in the sky☺️
Believe me that i enjoyed when i listen to it while driving. Raihana nailed it!

Единственный минус этого выступления, в том, что оно имеет конец.
Nada a ver
Só tem uma palavra igual
Mas essa louca tem que agradecer 
Essa coincidência
 de palavra
people may say that this performance was underwhelming but I beg to differ, the whole performance was so clean so incredibly well organized and the camera work was incredible! beautiful shots I realize I liked it so much because it totally feels like a music video but thats just me
Super sowe , bravo 👏
Je pratique l’anglais en vrai! 😃🤣
Bordel, c’est désagréable.
I am so thankful for you to be a good day at work now and then I will v I am a beautiful person who is this still available
Oui, j’assure la sécurité et je suis l’ennemi de ces deux personnes qui sont en fait des terroristes !
Rihanna doesn't need to prove anything, she doesn't need to show that she sings and dances, she doesn't need collaborations to help her rest between songs, costume changes, or fire on stage. ONLY HER and some amazing dancers. Undoubtedly the most beautiful performance in Super Bowl history. Whether you like to hear the truth or not, objectively she is the most complete artist and the one who has come the furthest in the 21st century. With this I am not attacking Beyoncé or anyone, because I love her, but Rihanna is the youngest of the best artists in the industry, and what she has achieved has not been achieved by anyone at her age. You may like it or not, but she is RIHANNA.
Totally lovely and amazing.

i love you rihanna😢
takes me a decade to understan her songs. but i still listened to them as a kid.  my native laungage is not english. so when i started learning, then i realise most of them are "broken songs" lol.  rihanna, lady gaga, britney. the queens of rnb's 20's.  now only few singers makes albums like them.

I loved this so much, would’ve loved to see that final stage in the sky in person!

Rihana es muy superior a otras artistas que se presentaron ahi , la mejor presentación de todas !!!
Beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Bro I cant stop Watching it😅😅
Just like Karaoke, lip syncing.  She missed so many cues, out of sync too many times.  Shameful!  Nasty dancing for prime time TV, acts nasty just like her loser criminal husband.  Boo Rihanna!!
So MANY of the episodes are bangers
My beautiful rihanna love you
I can literally watch this every day or whenever it comes up in my recommended. Just loved this performance from beginning to the end. The background dancers, her sign language interpreter- RihRih herself- entire performance was flawless, with ease and fun. Gosh what am iconic moment in history! So proud, we are the same age, I’m pregnant also- it just means so much! Love love and many thanks and support to all who were involved to make this such a special moment in time.
The chef they talked about finding at 27:54 ended up being my dad
❤❤❤❤
This performance will be legendary throughout the ages💞
Ouah😍😍😍😍😍😍
There is no excuse to say this is bad love you rianna
Rihanna’s popularity will grow tenfold cos of this performance 
I was never a fan 
Hadn’t even listened fully to any song…I’m 47 n stuck in the old school but I must admit I’m a fan now….she’s brilliant….

mon dieu comment c'est incroyable
Шикарная женщина ❤
I hate rihana
It's funny. I watched this the 1st time, not really liking it because I was so focused on Rhianna..I like her but was just not impressed with this performance. Then I started seeing all of Parris's (the choreographer and head of the dance group The Royal Family)  YouTube videos and how they practiced and rehearsed for this routine. The. I came back to watch this, and loved it. Not from Rhianna, but because of the amazing job the dancers did!! My God they were on fire the whole performance!!
I have never seen a singer like her. She performs dope and unstoppable even she's pregnant. Amazing performance! That's why I'm her old fan. Rihanna will always one of the greatest pop singer in the English pop music. Great! ❤ Her respect is grown up in my eyes forever.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👑
Красавица 😍
i really cant tell if she is live singing or lip syncing
They were somehow making the restaurant run for years until Gordon came and made it closed in 10 months.
Shout out to my little m.o.n.k.e.y mad luv for you all the way I wanna see you, us to grow old and keep the love and beauty flawless Pinay HAPPY BIRTHDAY from Ate Mo?
Это выступление одновременно впечатляет и устрашает. На таком сроке беременности устраивать концерт с танцами в невесомости, для беременной женщины это такое испытание. Не пожалели Риану ни разу, да и думать нужно! Всех денег не заработаешь, а жизнь и здоровье должны быть на первом месте. Особенно будучи беременной.... Браво певице, а тех кто это все придумал на плаху.
😍😍😍😍😍
4:18  muito bom 11:26 e 10:27 ótimo ninguém supera rihanna
Rihanna forever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A RIHANNA É UM ÍCONE, MUITO BRABAAA
I think these is my 234 or 235 times watching these 🥰🥰🫡🫡
Hysterical.  So this is what musical expertise looks and sounds like in the modern world....
Boring where? This was full of straight BOPS!!!
찢었다,,
❤
I can only imagine if she wasn't pregnant... She would of really killed the choreography 😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙌❤🙌❤🙌🇬🇷

The dancers are absolutely amazing! And the stage design and everyone's timings are so on point.
I love these songs
Just perfect 🔥

6:42 they did that rotation cuz she took a while to be seated ❤️ love ittt 😊
6:42 they did that rotation cuz she took a while to be seated ❤️ love ittt 😊
I’m 56 and this song and dance has me hooked and I also love how everyone is doing her dance on tiktok I love it
Out of this world!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
everyone else watching the show  me just thinking how sweaty those dancers are in those clothes
Idk just goosebumps and speechless, very stunning and iconic performance from Rihanna ever ! ❤
keren
I dont understand all the critisism that´s been flying around. If you´ve ever been pregnant or seen a pregnant person in your life, it´s pretty obvious what´s happening there and a lot of the dance-moves would be impossible to make with that bump, because the ab´s are starting to devide and movement in the lower back is restricted. Besides, she´s never been known to be a great dancer. I think she did very well considering that she´s pregnant. I would have not been able to, I threw up, 7 months straight.
The pregnant woman i never knew won't even climbs stair.
Now we hav a women dancing suspended 40 feet up in the air..
She deserves all the respect for her dedication ❤❤
Когда у меня депрессия я включаю и смотрю и слушаю. Меня это спасает. Делаю я это каждый день
Rihanna ur one if a kind❤

Stunning performance as always my queen rihanna
AMAZINGGGG🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yes ilove you Rihaaaanaaaa Africa women is every thing❤❤❤
Bata U music songs you tube channel Facebook page TikTok HD video wwwwcame
https://youtu.be/Vmf_5gvtPK4😂😂😂😂
you wouldnt want to be scared of heights to do this performance.....
13:03 yeah of course
I was really crying out when seeing this amazing performance and I also realized the impact of Rihanna's songs to my childhood...huhu, just missed it so much... The show is superb, amazing, fantastic !!! 
Then I literally think that I am going to her next concert (not sure when but I will save up from now) (hope) with my childhood friend who had with me a lot of sweet and crazy memories when we were teenager girls. I love Riri, her energy in the show was super great as always, plus with the baby inside her body. huhu... Awesomeeeeeee...
se rifo
The dancers are on!!!
白いダンサー陣じわってしまう😂😂😂
The more I watch the more I appreciate this
This was just a mashup of all the amazing songs Rihanna gave us plus the choreography was lit 🔥😂❤️
I remember when I was a kid terrified of "Illuminati" 😂if you simply Google the hand symbol you would know she's part of the record label that Jay Z owns and anyone who supports their music uses this triangle hand symbol.
I don't know how many times I watched Rihanna super bowl but still not over it yet...
❤
After another million years still you are the teacher and you are the only one teaching all these monkeys how to dance in a rainy day
Was Kanye supposed to come out?
She said she did this for her fans ❤ and we could not be more happy ❤ #navyordie
Hands down top 3 Katie Perrty 2 Tom Petty 1 Prince

Amazing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes! 🎉
Wow this is incredibly boring. I like her as a person, i think she's cool af this is just not great though.
12:48 -12:57 the cameraman deserves a bonus for that shot there.  She is legit a diamond in the sky
I ❤ RiRi ❤ The first  Jamaican woman to perform at the super bowl while pregnant! She killed it! I've been rocking with Rihanna since the beginning!

Beat that beyoncé! Lol just kidding I love bey too! 🫶🏼
ขนาดคุณเเม่ท้องนะเนี้ยสุดไปเลย❤❤ถ้าไม่ท้องอยุ่เต้นมันเลยล่ะ
OMG!!! WHAT A PERFORMACE!!! Perfect!!! Song, Flow, Dance and Rhythm!!!
I liked it right till the end when she did that stupid sign
Fk
I think the lighting took away from the choreography
No, this was not the normal performance routine from Rihanna, but I am sure its due to her pregnancy; she is being extra careful.
I love the music
The Best Ever Performance 🥰
Stupid outfits for the dancers. Could barely see their moves.. but its a powerful one to still be able to see those moves in those damn puffers
Que perfeito 😍😍😍
4:18 自分リピート用
dayumn she's fearless!
For the people saying this was a terrible performance, you really need to wake up to yourself ! Firstly she’s obviously pregnant, I wouldn’t be able to walk near damn that much let alone she’s performing for 13 minutes, id like to see you all do a performance like that for that long pregnant ! This was fking amazing !! Love you RiRi ❤
After looking at the performance for a second time I have a better appreciation of the expertise, precision and talent that was invested in this presentation. The choreography and the dancers truly enhanced Rhiana's performance. A real masterpiece. Congratulations to the entire team involved! Wow!
Queen is back❤️
What's with the fart wafting?
QUEEEN Rihanna
Rihanna’s backup dancers give me life💀
Tem q ser muito chato, pra dizer que essa performance foi feia. Lindo demais!!!
Rihanna my name is JoJo my name starts cyclist QL you don’t like feel like coming over but you can’t come over because I do not know how to text
Hell is a real place, populated with real people suffering real/intense agony from real fire and torments. Avoid it at all costs. Accept JESUS as your LORD and saviour and live for the Kingdom of GOD. John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son (JESUS). Nobody can see heaven except those who have accepted CHRIST and honestly believe that HE died and rose again on the third so our sins can be remitted and washed away. The Bible also tells us that childlike people will see the kingdom of GOD, not childish. This means to be pure in mind, heart and soul and be as innocent as a child.
just beautiful
Se a Anitta fosse metade que essa mulher é,essa é uma verdadeira Deusa
All of the lights goosebumps part.
Ohh non Riri c'est une machine 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Como se llama la canción donde comienza
9:02 THE ONE DOING THAT TIKTOK DANCE LMAOO

Qual o nome dessa música ?
For anyone looking the meme is at 5:21
Diosa❤
Third time commented 😅
I can't count how many times i watch RiRi. 🔥
She killed it. It annoys me with people saying, it was boring. 
She has the whole world 🌎 dancing 💃 the views alone speaks for itself.
❤❤❤
Cada curtida eu volto pra assistir ❤
That’s insane! how can a person sing 13 minutes straight without having a single break?

Edit: it’s different doing a mix of songs 13 mins straight. You can imagine this is a one song of 13 mins. She is not sharing the vocals with any other artists also and she is dancing. The concerts are 2 hours but most of the artists give a break or at least talk to the audience between two songs.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4:18 ❤
Da best Mahalo (THANKYOU) In Hawaiian

@13:04 They’re watching 👁️
Rihanna ,schwanger und singt und tanzt ,das ist der Hammer !Und ihre Aura der Wahnsinn wie immer 😊😊😊💋
The super bowl was so loud there that i wanted to run up and just steal the mic and make a run for it
🇧🇷
wish it wasn't lip syncing 90%
I been waiting 6 years for this and was not disappointed with only her presence anywhere it’s more than enough
Wow
Это можно смотреть бесконечно!❤
So many people say that this performance ain’t something special but like she is pregnant was SINGING standing on that thing many many feet above the ground. Shoot I’m not pregnant but I’m freaking scared of it
Fantastique ❤❤❤
did she really do an illuminati sign in the end? 😵‍💫
🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
My little sister watch Rihanna every day
Bu nasıl organizasyon bee mükemmel

No lie RIhanna Superbowl has been the most impactful because if you go online her RUDE BOY performance had global impact of people dressing in red and white to do the choreography . YOU GO GIRL!!!! That's why her longevity has been solidified in and outside the music industry

Me encanta 💖

Me encantoooooooooÓ
😲 wow
Genau. So. Macht man  das❤
Rihanna only performed 5 out of her 14 number 1 songs at the Super Bowl she could do it again and it would still be all hit songs
Most beautiful dance chorography 😍😎❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
can't stop watching this!❣️
No matter how many times I watched this, still amazed by her performance 😍
rihanna's performance is so trendy, it only makes you want to get up and follow suit, it's so fluid, simple and magnificent, congratulations, you're a queen of the game and congratulations to the dancers
slayyyyyyyy
❤❤
🎉🎉🎉
Omg Rihanna she's so pretty and loves patrol mohmoes💕😚😜😁
Go girl
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the kingdom of heaven and eternal life. To this, people would accept Jesus Christ in life in their hearts and told other people how Good he is, how he saves, heals and frees and gives eternal life for freе 38
Awesome performance ❤❤❤
I love it
The way this performance keeps growing on me! Love ittttt
In my opinion, this is the Superbowl which has the most stable sound, and also the sound is the same as in the clip studio. RIHANNA SLAYY
Secandu itu ampe sehari lebih dri 10x gw tonton😌
Phenominal ❤
Shame the baggy attire didn't do the dancers justice. From videos taken by the audience, they do look like moving blobs from afar. But after seeing the rehearsal videos, you can tell the movements were captivating and the choreography in general is just so addicting to watch. I come back to this every day and I can't get enough! Paris is a genius.
The transition to we found love, the drop, fireworks, camera angle, just amazing. Goosebumps at that moment
ventre en silicone : pas enceinte : mettre vidéo en ralenti (paramètre 0.25) à 3mn30 environ, c'est flagrant.
Te amamos! ❤
How many hits she has ?
This is crazy
How much songs she sing
She just rocked ❤
🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤
😍😍😍
🧐 LL.kk normal
4:07-4:10 she reminds me soooo much of how Selena Quintanilla Perez used to dance. Love this!!! Keep watching it over and over again.
퀄이 다르구나 ㄷㄷ
Wooooow increíble, me encanta cuando cómo canta y sus increíbles coreografías  .
If Monster and love the way you lie song sang by Rihanna then show satisfy
This show is like a drug. You will find yourself coming back bi-weekly 😭😍😋
I really love itttt!
Skipped silence 😂😂😂
My brain automatically has a  peaceful feeling  when I hear this  beautiful song. THANK YOU FOR WHOEVER HAS  MADE THIS SONG
I find all of this surreal
Surprised at a couple of the inclusions (mainly "Run This Town"), and even more surprised at some of the exclusions here. We didn't get Don't Stop the Music; S.O.S., Love on the Brain; Pon De Replay; Stay; Disturbia; Needed Me; Take a Bow; and just the briefest of nods to S&M, Kiss It Better, and What's My Name...plenty of less well-known hits she could've included too...gurl has so many to choose from.

Not to mention the trove of collabs she could've drawn more from, like: Love the Way You Lie; Hate That I Love You; Take Care, another of her Drake collabs; Rehab; Loveeee Song; Live Your Life; FourFiveSeconds; Consideration; Lemon; etc. Glad she included "All of the Lights" - even though that isn't really thought of as a Rihanna song - because her chorus is iconic and it suits the atmosphere of a massive sporting event so well.
💃💃😍😍🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why so many back up dancers tho
Amazing show 😮😮😮😮❤❤❤
I never forget Rihanna performance so intense and high level performance
One of the more boring half time shows !
Robyn Rihanna Fenty ❤️🫶🏽🫶🏽
One day we must be honest basF
It's phenomenal.
I just can't stop watching this from that day on ❤ I will love this Riri's performance for the rest of my life 😅
Parris Goebbels dancers are THE BEST. Pity they had to wear those silly costumes, as we couldn't see their iso moves.
🫶🏾🥵
GO. RIHANNA.
Rere did amazing even tho she was pregnant I was under the ☔ https://youtube.com/@Eatwithbrandon
lol
This will never get old. Rihanna is definitely NOT Beyonce. She's RIHANNA 🎉🎉 & had the entire stage to herself 💅🏾 watch the Queen werk it.
QUEM NAO PARA DE ASSISTIR? LIKEEEE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Shakira & JLo's halftime show was way more fascinating
My sister said that she do not care about Rihanna and I care about her and I love it
Low effort… still love you Rih
I know I’m typing again but men were wearing crop tops to 😂
Congrats on your baby 🥳
4:18 The Real DRIPPPP
Dang not her actually making the triangle with her hands at the end of her performance...like soo casually!
Eu também viciei
 Acho que esses bailarinos também são espetaculares.
She is a lagend
I guess this is the inspiration for all the performers on the world.
Is the best performance aver,❤❤❤

Oiiiiiiiiiiiii
The best one❤

The Best Súper Bowl Halftimeshow
I love how What’s My Name? introduced her to the World. That’s her best hit and everybody just knows what song it is with a simple “oh na na”. Iconic!
This is my 12th time watching this performance
When it comes to cooking Gordon is an absolute expert at roasting literally anyone for the flaws in their approach to it
Queen❤❤❤
Que Diosa mas perfectaa
she prenik
Our grandparents would be completely shocked by what is allowed to be shown on American television. Thoroughly disgusting.
Great❤
ICON
While other pregnant women are dying of nausea, ludosis pain and mood swings for her she's such okay, so mother's are blessed
I cant believe she did all of the lights that’s just awesome
The Best
Super Bowl
Rhianna and Rocky that's how you #manifest

Omg what I just saw. Slayed af. Next year I need Nicki Minaj ❤

So Hardworking Rihana Maam we are so proud of you👏👏👏🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏🥰🥰😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
I watch this everyday

Still watching Rihanna concert ❤
she sounds just like how she would in her MV..awesome
This is iconic and charmastic performance of Rihana ❤️✌️
Rihana slammed for lip syncing 🥵🥶

The dancers nailed it!!!dammm!!rihanna massive!!!
Without these dancers would have been a big flop … thank you to them !!!… a very big kudos to Paris G!
I don't know what people where complaining about, that was outstanding
Rihanna is a Diamond. I watched this performance several times, and still watching while singing every word!  Excellence!
El mejor medio tiempo, sin tantas cosas como los otros medios tiempos, solo Rihanna y bailarines, para 1 mes y medio ya va casi a la mitad del más visto 

Rihanna  no necesita tanto espectáculo como todos los demás, con su voz y éxitos es más que suficiente  ❤❤❤
It was so wholesome how the episode ended and then seeing the restaurant was closed was like someone threw me a bucket of cold water
Ariana Wow
Love her but that was the most lame SB half time show I  have seen.

I love your videos SO MUCH RIHANNA
This is the best half time show eveeeerrrrr ❤❤. On God
....
Great music and choreography but the the energy is loss when the camera is on Rihanna.
🎉Rihanna
There’s something about this performance that’s so elegant or maybe that’s just Rihanna.
Esse sinal de triângulo, o que significa?
🎉dancers
THEM CELLS WAAAAS WORKIN ❤😂 CONGRATS ON BABYYYY

Baby got moves bro but you do to babe 😂😂😂😂
Rihanna will forever be an iconic boss😭♥️🔥
I think it’s cool a pregnant woman did this🥰
This sucks.
Why did she threw up the illuminati triangle at the end of the performance ? They’re not even hiding it anymore
Wow super hot 🔥 iloveyou rihanna😘🥰
Very nice
I am so happy
Es maravillosa....la mejor, se ve hermosa y lo mejor super super talentosa.
I'm so glad she didn't throw up or pass out that's crazy my 4 kids gave me hell...that early until 6months...props to rihanna🎉❤😮😊
Ela merece o mundo❤❤
Nice nod to the illuminate
Rih you are the Queen of the world 🛐🥹❤️

It would be so cool if Marzia told you a  recipe a step-by-step in Italian and you had to follow it

🎉
You are so cute and good
All of the lights.
Lei bellissima e bravissima.
Con il pancione esibirsi in questa maniera così straordinaria e intensa può risultare molto difficile.
E invece lei ha cantato come se non lo avesse... incredibile

Però mi vorrei soffermare sui ballerini.
Togliendo il fatto che erano una marea, ma sono stati eccezionali. 
Tecnica e coreografia straordinarie.
Per non parlare che durante l'esibizione erano praticamente tutti sincronizzati tra di loro.... cosa da non sottovalutare! In pochi, pochissimi gruppi ci riescono.
Non oso immaginare il lavoro che c'è stato dietro, le prove fisiche e le pressioni psicologiche che molto probabilmente avranno subito prima dell esibizione.
Comunque sono stati IMPECCABILI.
Bravissimi, veramente!!!❤
Как перестать это смотреть?
Ответ: никак.
Ри, ты монументальная личность, совершенный человек, редкой красоты женщина!
Sigo tan enamorada de tí cmo esa primera vez que te ví en la performance cn Eminem miamoooooor 😭💗💋💋
Omg! It’s so incredible, I listen this on repeat every moment!!!
7:05 is crazy impressive. a literal ab workout
Your pregnant
I love it!!
I think Pewds is transforming into an angry Italian chef.
❤
The numbers don’t lie!
Wawa when I'm with you I was going to swat us while

Love u queen ❤🇹🇷

She's not corny like other pop singers
Rih is basicly most of our childhood
Faltou, needed me, love on the brain, shut up drive, um monte
Leaving this comment here in 2023 i’ll come to look for it in 2030😩😍😍😍😍😍
Big up to people who were controlling every move of the stages on air thats so damn epic . the dancers timing was on point everyone played their part so perfectly . And Rihanna doing that while pregnent plus all the days it took of practice
O
Rihanna is truly a superstar!! !!🙌🏽❤️🫶🏽🇹🇹🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 💯
Todo dia te escuto Rihanna 💕
Ela fazendo carão quando começa Where Have You Been é tudo pra mim ❤
This will go down in history… as one of the worse halftime shows

The best Super Bowl show since Prince. One of the three best ever. Rihanna, Michael Jackson, and Prince, in a class of their own. And the choreography by Parris Goebel? Damn. Incredible. Incomparable. Props to those dancers, and above all, to Rihanna.
unrepeated legend ❤️

0:07 What’s my name ?
Does anyone know the hand gesture at the end .. like a triangle sign??
His son dances on her stomach 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Once again rihanna ❤!!!
That was a lovely illuminati triangle symbol she gave us at the end of the performance. Truly corruptive. 😒
The     best   horegrafia riri N 1  show briliant  ever😊
she probably just had a swollen stomach!!!!!!!!!!
Who watched this just to see why people are making fun of the back up dancers
👇
👍💜🧡💛💙💚❤️💖💝
❤️
Love Rihanna personality 👏
Esta mujer es el final 😊
Constant crotch grabbing, smelling and licking her fingers in front of the worlds children..this pervert should be banned from everything
Rumo a ser o mais visualizado no YouTube tb ❤❤❤❤
Okay I get why people are saying this is the worst superbowl half time show.  Mostly men watch football and most men don’t listen to rhiana. Do better next year nfl.
Hi
So good 😍
I’m here again, so good!!
Wow ! Woow!! Wooow!!!
13:04 illuminati sign😮

Ik a tribute to Kanye when I see one 🖤😌💯 she real for that 🔥🔥🔥
Bana charlie’nin  çikolata fabrikasını hatırlattı dansçılar😅👏🏻👏🏻
hires hundreds of dancers to do her job...she hardly moves herself. Sry
So simple yet so loud ❤
An huge applause to the dancers, omg! And for Rihanna , just amazing

리리야 내한와줘 제발❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Does anyone know what did she do with her hands on the end? She made a triangle witht them. Does  anyone know what it meant?
I love you Riri 😭😭😭
Stop
Это было идеально!!!
If I see one snippet on Tik Tok of Rihanna’s performance at Super Bowl 2023, I go to YT and watch the entire halftime show.  She is beyond beautiful, talented, wholesome, inspirational - I pray RiRi and Rocky have eternal bliss❤
Nach Michael Jackson... die geilsten Moves aller Zeiten... in der ganzen menschlichen Geschichte. Respekt, Chapeau an die Choreographin.
one of my favorite rnb singer RIHaNna
As a former person who has been in many musicals: this is amazing. Not only was she pregnant but also she and the dancers had the same amount of energy going through the show.  I have been a background dancer and it’s hard too keep the energy yet alone especially without breaks!
I loved it! I love her!
Шикарная😊
Love the fact that she's pregnant while doing this, it's women empowerment
Dear person thats reading this, i know we dont know each other, i wish that you have a wonderful blessed life ❤🎉

Choreography is not good
Rihanna actually is lip syncing here cause she's pregnant and might cause her voice to miss note

Te quiero mucho Riri 🥺

Actually, ASAP Rocky and Rihanna are one of my favorite couples. ASAP is about as cool as cool can possibly be, and Rihanna has that type of beauty and cuteness that makes you say,
"Aw, Sweetumz!", When you see her 💗
OMG!!! Rihanna, Oh My GAWD!!! You did it again, Baby! We love you so in Philly, and much Congratulations to you Brother ASAP on Parenthood! 💗
You just love Rihanna.❤
I don't understand why people say rihannas halftime show was boring but it's not.
MY GIRL IS STRONG
GIRL PERFORMED WITH A CHILD IN HER BELLY
Non de la musique
120 milhões em 1 mês. Só a Minha Rainha faz isso ❤❤❤
Every time I watch I get tears of Joy❤❤❤❤
That one dancer during the freestyle tho 😂😂
Can never get tired of watching this !!
Fun fact: when rhianna was doing her quick touch up, that was actually a free ad for her makeup line Fenty
Her voice is so sexy and keeps making good RiRi ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Award for the worst possible aesthetic...incredibly depraved.  Well, your eyes have seen it.
Eu me emocionei 😭
SO HIT ATRÁS DE HIT. AMO ESSA MULHER
I love you rihanna
la mejor presentación que ha tenido el super bowl
But good performance 👍
❤
Foi tudo perfeito a Rihanna a equipe de transmissão da tv com as melhores imagens os câmeras no meio dos dançarinos com a mesma roupa dos dançarinos para nao seres percebidos os dançarinos otimos foi tudo perfeito outro nivel parabens a todos ❤❤❤
I super love this performance of Rhianna x baby 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Ella si sabe hacer estas presentaciones como se debe es tan profesional Rihanna ❤🖤
I don't think I will ever be bored by Rihanna's performances because she is always on top.
Please I want name the first 2 song name???
Brazilian funk at 4:19 ❤🎉
Eu amo essa mulher ❤❤❤
só podemos comparar com outros shows , pensei que algo magico como o show de cold play ou mesmo shakira
It’s fake guys
크게 동작안하는거같은데 존나 멋있다. 미쳤다 진심
amazing😍
Есть тут русскоговорящие? Что показала Риана в конце? Что за треугольник?
The best Rihanna ❤

RiRi did that while pregnant🎉🎉🎉You go girl❤
Это восторг , до мурашки ❤ Обожаю Рианну ❤
r &ppppppppp po
Superb😍😍👏👏
Her hair is always a mess. The ponytail is thin. But that was a good show
06:41 ooooffffff !!!!!!!!!!🔥
How do I stop this from playing this?
Riri 💗💗💗💗
I was really hoping for chris brown to make a Comeback!!
Her  backup dancers and her lip syncing were not it 🤣🤣🤣
The person who arranged this music set, did an amazing job
This, in my honest opinion, is the best performance in the world. No other performance beats this one, not even Michael Jackson's or Beyonce's, no disrespect but Rihanna just made history.
Slayyyyyyy I literally head bang to this in my car
love
PERFECT
Im from Brazil...Brazilians love this music...Brazil is Earth of samba, carioca funk, young rock 80 and sertanejo (brazilian country) : Brazil. But we love american music
If Kanye and Jay Z would have shown up, the crowd would have gone crazy. 3 billionaires.
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c3c9xCmwI4o - Here my DrumVersion of Umbrella on this concert :p
I haven’t seen a good super-bowl performance like this one since MJ. I wish that they would do a more classic halftime show and solely feature some of our countries amazing marching bands every once and awhile. Unfortunately whoever picked the wardrobe should have made better choices, they masked some great dance moves.
I just know that game was good
Best performance ever❤
How beautiful
Not me watching this over and over again
....Wait did she really jus grab herself and smell it??? 😶🙊🙊
Achei fraco.
She killed it❤❤❤❤
Omg love her❤
Not her ending the performance with a triangle 😳
The fact I go back and watch this on a daily
5:15  The way that they crawl💀

But a Britney comeback would’ve been better
They should’ve had Beyoncé perform instead🙄
She is the moment 🔥🔥🔥
5:20
I Would be Really exhausted if I was one of the dancers.
Sound quality sucks
Rihanna was really enjoying herself on that stage God bless you and your family keep making good❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Rhianna is in the new super smash bros arena
Thank you for this wonderful video! I have incurred so much losses trading on my own....I trade well on demo but I think the real market is manipulated.... Can anyone help me out or at least tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Прости Господи! Не ведают, что творят.
I've lost count of how many times I've watched this magnificent presentation.
AT THE END SHE HAD A VISION OF ECSTASY
Elle a assuré le show toute seule.c’est la seule et unique reine 👑
Imagine if she isn't pregnant

Dope
Easy payday for maestro Nuno Bettencourt :p
Uh what’s with the triangle sign at the end? The performance was great- she didn’t move around a lot which I’ll chalk up to her being pregnant so thankfully the dancers carried that part but the journey through the music she created was fabulous. The triangle sign at the end was weird and not a good look.
4:50 Did she just do what I think she did in front of millions of people?!?!
❤
SHIEN BRIGHT LIEM DIAMOND OHHHHHHHH that’s literally my fav part

it's was a nice game 🏈
Omagaaa queeennn ❤❤
O número de plataformas é a quantidade de tempo que ela n fazia apresentações ou eu tô doido
It’s crazy how guys are allergic to real raw talent? This is voice perfection. Performance sheer perfection. Nobody can duplicate a Rihanna swag. Has anyone who commented even seen her sing live acoustic? 😆 Deeply ashamed for all the bad, inaccurate comments here.

Props to Rhianna for doing while pregnant a lot of women would never do the things she is done.
If you have never been pregnant- it’s hard to move that much with a big belly! So impressed with this half time show!  Love it! 🥰
Me gustaría hair concierto canciones 😊❤❤🎵
E
🔺️ que significa el triángulo 🔺️  que hizo con la mano al final?

I just realized Rihanna and the dancers performing on those cabled platform was si unstable. You really need to have guts to stay there for a long time. That performance showed how amazing rihanna at her job

There is nothing too impressive about the show. Not bad.. just nothing special. She is still sexy, though.
I don’t know who Rihana is in the first place, but after watching this video make me realize…







She’s the QUEEN!❤❤❤
Women are so amazing, look at her, nothing stops her. Baby’s definitely going to have music in their bones. She’s an inspiration ❤

Rihanna has such a beautiful voice
What a performance! ❤
One of the greatest singers in history , but boring show ???
Not me watching the video and repeating all the steps in front of a mirror like a dancing chicken😂
Rihanna, the reasons You're getting negative response on your performance "It's was awesome" There are a lotta jealous people's in this world and I didn't see you doing nothing that was insulting. People's have to understand you are a performer and that's part of your act. This was the best I've seen in years🎼🎶🎵🎵🎶🎼
Как время летит, я думал она всё ещё беременна первым 😆
Yes baby we gonna run this town tonight
The best of thrones theme de fayt yuo yes
Her dream comes true

I'm trying to understand the triangle sign she made at the end. What does it mean? Please can someone explain to me!

5:20 is what you're looking for.
Slayyyyy
I cried at every new song she started 😭❤️❤️
1:25
so basically the main performer dances the same as the side ones and trying to entertain the crowd but here rihanna's the queen of this stadium and everyone is dancing due to here movement and it's both insane and incredible
the dancers look like they are spasming out.
Is Rihanna pregnant ???
Like the fact miosq
ЧТО ЗА ДИЧЬ?
What a waste of time! That show was just a advertising for her business to made her more money and for satanic community though. Elhamdülillah, I'm muslim. Allah always see and know everything. Allah with muslims. 🕋🕌
i love all her oompa loompas!
lookin like marshmallows
Fall Rihanna fall
The. Best. Girl you are the one that I'm looking for okay
A gravação do vídeo saiu muito baixo, tinha que ter o volume mais alto. Mais o show está top. ❤❤❤✅
Girl. I. Love this song
I love rewatching this
And here I am still waiting for Spiderman to perform umbrella
Cardi b was there
She's lip syncing
Запрещаю
QUEEN 👑  LEGEND ❤
❤❤❤❤
i am crushing on her so hard
It just gets better and better
Like how she clinches her ass.
She‘s a smart woman. Michael Jackson loved to adorn himself with Van Halen, Slash or Steve Stevens on the guitar. She has Nuno Bettencourt … not the worst choice.. Respect! 😂
Eu amo ela!!!
diva
What a stunning performance Rihanna,  your G.O.A.T ranked

This is the difference between Kpop and other International artists. 
Dancers be dancers. Singers be singing
Залипла, грандиозное шоу🎉 
И носик припудрила, и страховочный трос предусмотрела. 
Цвет и фактура ткани кобинезон@пуховик вобще отпад. 
Я сначала решила, что не знаю эту певицу, а оказалось все песни Рианны слышала, в фильме видела. 
Интересно, зрители после её выступления на футбол остались?😊
HOW CAN SHE SING WITH HER BABY IMPOSIBLE
Ni puede ser no respeta su embarazo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lafama jjjjjj🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣se les sube ala cabesa siempre kieren más 🤣🤣

It’s like, the first time you watched it, you didn’t enjoy it. But now, it’s like the more you watch it again, the more you like it. Something about this performance keeps you addicted and makes you want to watch it again

Bruh why is no one talking about the fact she exposed herself, saying she sold her soul... illuminati is real. It has been real all along
Super
I’m amazed how the dancers were still dancing in those extreme positions! I would be dead at this point 😂
SUPREMA, QUEEN de la musica pop por siempre entre mis artistas favoritas 😍😍😍😍
Biggest popstar in the WORLD!!! RIHANNA <3
Ya , en serio. ¿ Qué significa el símbolo que hace al final con las manos ?
d-damn
Adorei o show e amei
Rihanna is truly one of a kind 
I am so in love with this woman, she is just so great.
I think God perfectly waited patiently and created her in more glory, this woman is so blessed
I couldn’t help but cry when I heard the lift me up cus I was not the least expecting her to come back that hard, I seriously missed her and am grateful she is giving us a chance and hope that everything will be alright 
I love you Rihanna
Funk brasileiro pro mundo inteiro 🥰
I dunno. This is just weird
Super Star ⭐⭐⭐ baby in stomach

Remember when they actually sung the full song and the performances meant something.
I know that they pretape the music but in this performance, it looks like the vocals are pretaped also.  I can see this on Top of the Pops.  Give a REAL performance.

I love it❤
This woulda been a dope ass MTV awards show performance. The costumes look like astronauts and the arena looks like space!! ❤
Amaaaazing perfomance
I was watching something else on yt and got up to do something and my pinky clicked on this video and I didn’t even correct course…. “Watch Rihanna’s halftime show for the 15th time? Don’t mind if I do” 💅
When I watched this Rihanna Super Bowl performance for 10000 times already and I can still remember all the songs she sang,  makes me realize the kind of impact her music will always have in this life and  even in 2090 even then this performance by Rihanna will still be remembered by me, and by that assumption I then command the whole vast world to obey my will Already and make it so
My new comfort video 😂
Studio version - https://youtu.be/zCO55voXj7k
Increíbles canciones y los bailarines,  me faltó más actitud de rihanna
Best time to be a kid was Late 2000s and Early 2010s.

Rihanna Ran The World That Night
MARAVILHOSA DEMAIS; SHOW ÉPICO; NÃO ME CANSO DE ASSISTIR;
Props to the choreographer and back up dancers. They made the show. Just wish Rihanna could have had more energy and slayed the performance but it’s been a whole since she’s performed and she was pregnant.
I always listen to this (it is so good)
I love it!❤

Wo gibts den Schlafsack zu bestellen?
Final não poderia faltar a simbologia ! De resto muito bom
It sucked😂😂😂
Who else came to watch it today!? ATP, I'm obsessed. 🤣🤣😭😭😭
Вы хоть поняли масоский символикой,  и пирамиды показания,  антихрист придет в мир , 😮😢символы показывают .Блять когда танцевала мадонна и там были противогазе  означало ,  облики это преддверии кавида. Твою мать подумайте народ .
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love it I keep coming back to watch it. Dam, and that lady is preggars. I love the choreography. 💯👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I keep watching it 😂😂😂😂
Growing up listening to this from the beat or kiss 100❤❤
Рианна прекрасна! Она королева! Спасибо за шоу! Это было потрясающе! Представляю, как будет гордиться ее малыш, когда вырастет и увидет всю мощь этого выступления!
Хочу к ней на подтанцовку!
I just realized Riri’s songs got me through highschool😢❤ They always went viral here in Nigeria
BROOOOOTHER!! EL PERFORMANCE DE LA SUPERBOWL, LA COREOGRAFA, BAILARINES, EL DJ!!!!!  TODO EL EQUIPO ENCARGADO DE QUE ESTO FUERA POSIBLE, NO OLVIDARÉ ESTA PUESTA EN ESCENA. INCREÍBLE!!!
Iyau
Rihanna is the best of all time myca ous you go all the way in South Africa
I Love it❤❤❤😊
Dj brazilian 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Another thing I want to say is, why has it only taken people mainly until this decade to complain about singers lip syncing. Not kidding I hear and see it more now than in the 2010's (I mean I hear and see people complain more now than in the 2010's, 2010-2019,)
❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ONE MONTH 100 million
so many people took the triangle simbol at the end saying it was a illumenaty plagiarism while seeing the whole performance you can understand that she was mentioning diamonds in the sky 😂 people omg 😂
Power of lighting plus art!❤
เป็นคอนเสิร์ตที่สุดยอดมาก❤❤❤
Шикарное исполнение👍🌷🌷🌷
Lmao the male dancers were definitely showing out for Rihanna during "Work" 5:10
AMAZINGGGG
Это прекрасно.  Но боюсь представить во сколько это обошлось оршанизаторам , и какой она получила гонорар!  Шоу- прекрасно!

I like to think that 5:20 isn't choreographed but it's that guy's genuine reaction
Didn’t think they could top last years Halftime w/Dr.Dre but this is definitely up there

I’ve heard her songs everywhere I’ve been listening too all her songs I listened to all her songs she’s such a optimistic person very positive and such a good singer
What an energetic performance ❤
Yeah

This looked boring

Congratulations
😍😍😍
Her cinematography/videography, dancers precision was🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥, she is worth her status
Hermosa la Diva
J’adore cette vidéo elle me fait pleurer à chaque fois 😭♥️
I like others felt a bit disappointed at her performance initially, over the past weeks I have watched remakes on TikTok & was like yes the dancers carried her show, but I have 2day sat & watched and I marveled at what this woman did. First & foremost we have to remember she is the creative genius behind this production, I watched & rewinded every min & sec of this video, IT WAS PERFECTION. Every movement/motion was in sync, there was no glitches, her flow from one song to the next was smoothly done, her dancers discreetly harnessing & unharnessing  & putting on her coat & gloves was great, the floating platforms was creative & timely, this didn't look like a live show it looked like a music video. Her dancers were awesome but RIHANNA WAS AMAZING
I have no words I am excited this for me is the best super bowl in history Ri I applaud you standing I love you infinitely I love you, I love you ❤
First APPLE Superbowl halftime show?
Rihanna tore that stage up. Great performance, Rihanna❤🎤🎶
Is it just me or does many of the backup dancers looked like lik wayne😂

She’s an amazing singer, a beautiful woman, a great performer, and I think its awesome that she performed pregnant… it could have been a bit cleaner though; there are children watching these shows.

Un show a su estilo ❤ Hermosa Rihanna❤️😍👌🏻
No offense but they could have chose someone this year that was capable of giving 100%. She just couldn’t really “give” frfr for obvious reasons
Iconic woman 🌠

This girl can sing better than me this Sloan this is just my dad's picture and these dancers are perfectly on point.
I love you, Rihanna
Amo muito
I can't articulate how much I love this song. I feel like I'm in heaven, enveloped in clouds and the power of love. Nothing can bring me down from this elation. I'm just simply floating so resolutely in the ethereality of her voice.♡♡♡
https://youtu.be/rebU91cj1wU
Rihanna, please tell Barack and Michelle Obama to leave my brother's house in Hamilton. I don't like them.  They are getting me angry.
We feel it’s little hard for her. She is courageous.

That baby when he or her ask mom when i was on tv and she going to 0say yes
It was fantastic from Rihanna👏
Não me canso de ver todo dia minha Diva RiRi❤
4:02 Rihanna dancing like she's sitting in traffic on her way home from work and her favorite song just came on the radio😂

I couldn’t even walk up my stairs when I was pregnant without running out of breath. Props to riri for doing a whole ass performance 👏🏼
I am sure there’s other artists with a couple of minutes of pregnancy performing in the super bowl lol
A perfomance dela no superbowl foi melhor do q nós oscars
Well, obviously she performed while being pregnant so she can have people like you commenting about it. :)
I like this lady so much, but why would she throw The Eye of Providence at the end of the performance? 🙄🙄
Followme
No puedo dejar de escucharlo

this video seriously has an audio level issue, i dont think people have noticed , but the audio is extremely low

Re performance was better than the Dr. Dre and the rap avengers, but hands down Prince half time performance was No. 1
One republic should be in the halftime show
I'm here watching her, again and again and again... She's a Queen!!! ❤❤❤❤
I love her and i love her even more! Look at that! Her power being a woman on stage with a baby performing at the SB 2023 aaand gets nominated in Oscars!!

Bible, Ecclesiastical Chapter 7 Verse 5 and Roman's 6:23! Please ya read it! Follow God! Save yo Soul! I'm praying for ya n I Love You! Jesus is Coming Back Again!
Odiei a coreografia dos dançarinos 🤢
I literally cried out! Didn't know Rihanna's songs had impacted as a part of my childhood and my past.
I can't stop watching this show, haters gonna hate
WORK YESSS
I wish I was lucky to have Rihanna as my mom 😢
4:02 has to be my fav part👏
Ririi❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Rihannaa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Trinidad boi hmm, how top female rappers come from there, it's the rythm
Imagine super-bowl Miley
Já perdi as contas de quantas vezes vi essa apresentação da riri, maravilhoso, orgulho desse remix em versão funk que nosso brasileiro fez ,ficou fantástico!
Mas penso ,que ela dele ter ficado com medo de ficar nessa altura, eu fico apavorada só de vê ainda mais grávida!Ela é muito corajoso até pq ninguém do evento sabia que ela está gestante
Is RIRi pregnant with baby #2?!? 😮😮
Still can't get over this performance 😍 😭
what is hir backup moves?
Read some comments.  . .  Did she really make the Illuminati symbolism? 😮 Shits weird.
what is hir baby doing?
Her real name is robin
COME IN RUDE BOY COME IN RUDE BOY BOY COME IN RUDE BOY COME IN RUDE BOY
❤❤❤❤❤
A mí me gustó ..❤❤
🔺️
11:10 11:14 11:14 11:15  goooooo riri
❤❤❤❤❤😍
Simplesmente Ela
Apenas ahora veo detenidamente este show. Y wow que bonita se ve bailando embarazada. Que gran show. 💖
😍😍😍
😅
Amo
Galinggg❤️‍🔥
Am I the only one addicted to this video performance?
Let's make this #1 on Nfl channel Navy!
8:40 The song please
On point and slayed
❤❤❤❤
She killed this set!!
I thought Rihanna was just a regular singer, now their making fun of Jesus?
Please release this mix on streams!!!
WOAH!!! Love u Riri❤❤❤❤
Still crying even tho I have seen this a hundred times already. I can’t even begin to tell y’all my love for her. She and her music truly saved my life in a way I can’t fully comprehend or explain. I can’t wait to see what’s next for her. A LEGEND. She made HISTORIH ❤️
Rihanna the Best ❤❤❤
I'm sorry but being heavily pregnant, she did not need to be in risk like that. She really should've just danced instead of being on a high moving stage on wires. It's like when people ride a horse while pregnant. U just don't do that.
4:18 This beat is Brazilian funk. Just like hip hop, funk's origins come from the slums of Rio de Janeiro in the mid-80s. The genre has always suffered a lot of prejudice from society, but little by little it gained space in the mainstream media to the point that a remix reached one of the biggest sporting events in the world sung by one of the greatest artists in the world!

"It's the sound of a black person, of a slum dweller, but when it plays, nobody stands still"
Those dancers deserve an award😍
Rihanna linda exelente presentación yo  diria una de las mejores me estremeció todas sus canciones❤️❤️🥰🥰🇵🇪🇵🇪
Tu sposi schiaffi lui ti piace
Is she prégnante again ???
Bellísima y talentosa mi reina ❤
Hi

Приходите смотреть клип Хабиб "Ой какая ты". Он классный.
El problema con este súper tazón fueron las cámaras ni se les vio la calidad de los bailarines
Que performance perfeita!
Riahana é mesmo maravilhosa!
❤❤❤
Rihanna deserves all the merits she can get. A queen in her own right...she is simply outstanding!
I literally listen to all her albums and I literally love her so much
I am sure I am in the minority, but despite her energy while heavily pregnant and flawless vocal delivery and all those hanging platforms and great dancers, this feels underwhelming.
❤️❤️❤️
It just got better and better.😄👌
QUEENNN
Excellent!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉

This show was so amazing! Her voice, the visual aspect, the nostalgia, all of it was incredible! This one will be hard to top for sure!
i rihanna but it's sad that the weeknd got like 50+ million views for his superbowl performance.
❤❤❤❤❤
The smile @ 6:40 is when Rihanna realized “damn I knew I should have played this one!”

Diva l love you baby 🍼❤
I can't get over this 😭😭😭😭🥲❤️‍🔥

I'm impressed by the choreographer and costume designer. The dancers wear  jackets to make an illusion  since Rihanna cannot move  a lot due to her  pregnancy...
Omg... higshest views till now  for this superbowl performance...11 crore views

F**k the pregnant cow! Where's Nuno?
Яка вона крута😍
Galing 🎉
I cannot stop watching and listening to this video. It is amazing!!
THIS IS LEGENDARY
This is probably the most entertaining super bowl performance EVER 💃💃💃💃
i love all boys to dance a rude boy and work😘😘😘
I love you Rihanna
i wish rihanan was my wife
Hate hate hate the outfits but love the performance! I also love that they made so many of the dance moves pregnancy friendly so she could still move with the dancers
Aburrida a no poder mas, lo siento
I like to acknowledge when I'm wrong. I'll admit, I was less than blown away when I first viewed this. I guess I was expecting something more like Beyonce. That said, this is one of the best superbowl halftime shows EVER. The production is top-level and the choreography and song mixing is EXCELLENT. If you don't like this, something is wrong with you.
Ok can we talk about the choreos ? Like she ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS
No matter what happened, they should have had a child together with chris
Watching over and over and over and over and over again ❤
Rihanna is the blueprint omg
queen
This turned me into my true self “the crackhead”😂😂😂😂
guys. 
at 9:28 
what's the title of the song?

thank you 😘
The queen is back ❤❤❤
VERY GOOD THANK YOU
Brasil presente
I love you
Տարբերվող❤
She had so many other songs she didn't play that are super hits also. That's to show you how much of a star she is.
🔥🔥🔥
by far, this is the most iconic and successful Halftime performance after the MJ's in my opinion! Look at the views, even the shakira-jlo one is 277M in three years, and this one is 120M plus in just one month, could be a billion in few years! I'm so proud to be a #RihannaNavy!
Я ревела как тварь на Dimond’s😢😢 просто иконичная песня
How can people so blindly ignore the bold symbolism of demons and angels, and look who is center stage? A demon herself, she needs Jesus, we all do! Christ is King 👑!
DOPE!!!
Princess of Shangdong!! 🎉
D uniform dance steps are so unique
singer with natural beauty...i really admire a Rihana who without changing anything on her body but so beautiful with a beautiful voice...
Themmmm
Wie hübsch sie einfach ist ❤
The Dancers👏👏🔥🔥
I pretty sure after that concert , her baby still dancing inside her belly😅😅😅wont take a rest😅😅
Iconic
She is always nailed 🔥🔥🔥
This show sucked
So cool Rihanna 🙌❤️ And shout out to the amazing back up dancers 🔥🔥🔥
at 9:02 if u can see , theres a marshmallow sneaking in a tiktok dance 😭
im crying... incredible woman and performance
If anyone is willing or needing this, God is so good, I pray if you haven't made Him your Lord and Saviour you choose to do that today. Romans 10:9 says  "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." Stay in repentance, we all are sinners the difference is there are sinners then there is saved sinners. God loves all and is waiting for His children to turn back to Him but time is coming to an end. God bless you all, grace, peace and love of the Lord be with you ❤
It's been a month but I've watched this more than 40 times so it doesn't add up ❤️
Cool
Bro I loved this video SO MUCH. I really hope you do more
I honestly enjoyed watching her perform. Kiddo is super lucky!

No se... msj jenn

Decile que digo yo que no hable más boludeses...
I laugh and I don't laugh...
Love the music but hate the illuminati throw at the end lmaoo sold out btch
How do we call this kind of swinging stage?
I’m gonn watch this every time it pops up 😂❤️
hermosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.....
I give RI so much respect for this performance. Like this performance was tough for her. 2 hold your composure up there on that square, thinking of not falling over for 15 minutes. While pregnant. That's different. Asap a lucky man.
I heard people talking about how dirty is the platform that she stands on while singing diamonds. I think that's powder that makes the platform less slippery.
yo dsp de ver el video 85 veces
This Lil mama rocked the Super Bowl.
LEYENDA❤
Não me canso de assistir ❤
Big star baby she or he will me like there mother ❤❤❤😁😁😊😊😊
Im obsessed
The Illuminati at the end got me questioning why
Y’all saw the Illuminati sign at the end 🤔🤔mmmm you good Rihanna??????
I'm in love with the dancers ❤ they do all the show. Thank you very much !!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️
8:20 is when she puts on her makeup

Go ahead girl

Rt eeee u ghju

Love and respect you Rihanna🇹🇱🇦🇺🇮🇩🇳🇱
The fact that this has more views than the actual Super Bowl should be illegal.
Putaquepariu
forget queen Bey  Rih Rih rocks.   best super bowl half time show ever.  Now watched it ten times and it gets better each time
❤
the more i see this the more I realize how much of a queen Rihana is!
SHE ATE DOWN
Nikki Minaj
Fantastic performance! I cannot believe she pulled this off at this point in her pregnancy. I loved the choreography, wardrobes, and the dramatic transitions. I acted a fool watching this 😂. Very proud of Rih, congrats mama!
I cried four times during this...
Oh boy
The fact she is performing while being pregnant while I'm here not being able to wake up from bed
❤❤❤😂🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤
Muuuy bueno!!!!
❤️🎶
3:11 yessir

1B 👇👇👇
Well that was a show 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You did amazing Riri, I love you. I've been your fan since I was a little girl. Seeing this halftime made me feel nostalgic. You shone like never before! ♥Beautiful ♥
I think she is lip-sinking
Is this her new album
Rihanna carried the music industry in her back during the 2010s. She deserves that break
Rihanna makes me wanna have a pregnant gf
Just a few seconds in and I’m still amazed 
How tf could anybody have a problem with this performance giving all the circumstances
Those people in white supposed to be dancing babies?
she's 😮
What a day salvation is today for a life with out Jesus he make your life please full I know your life is difficult because you have mony but you haven't Jesus
i cannot and will not ever get over this performance
Nobody speaks of the dancers
Rihanna que linda
motorolaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
😮e😮r❤❤😂❤❤
Абсолютно каждую песню знаю, хоть и не особо слушал её. Восхитительно! 🔥
She and her team smashed it 👏
Rihanna is the greatest of all the time
Felicidades Rihanna
Isso aqui é insuperável!!
12:56

And you wonder why aliens are coming the amount of energy that produced was insane
Is riri pregnant ?
🤩🤩🤩🤩
❤❤❤beautiful. She’s so amazing and talented ❤❤❤

Dangerous, irresponsible.  Other than that good performance.
1:40
The dancers here tho, literally ate the whole performance and left no crumbs 🔥
Funk 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷⚽️⚡️🔥
Quantas vezes você viu Rihanna no Super Bowl? Sim!!!
Ela já e o próprio espetáculo... não e preciso de mais nada ❤
04:29
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love her tiny swag moves I think because of her pregnancy she’s just being careful. Rihanna really nailed it. I watched it 5x. 😅
The dancers are so great. Especially in 4:18 Rude boy dance moves. But overall, WHAT A PERFORMANCE! I’m really a fan of rihanna ever since. I love Riri ♥️🔥👌

She is just damn❤
I love you Rihanna congratulations two you and your man and your baby u deserve everything you get and more god bless you sweetie
Membawa kan 15 lagu dalam keadaan mengandung. Rihana begitu hebat 
Aku ingin melihat taylor Swift suatu saat konser sambil mengandung juga
That illuminati triangle at the end tho
literally the only thing the kardashian’s can’t copy.  *pure talent*
Amazing how they are fully dressed and still so very attractive. 4:24.. that guys keeps my attention the entire performance. I do not know who he is but gosh ah mighty!
Amo ❤
What in the 2023 are those dance moves..?
She is AWESOME!!!!!!!!
This was RIHlly lit...And to think that she coulda done 15 completely different songs and this woulda still been hella fire 💥
MUSIC DIVA, I've been watching this show for a month 😘😍
DIVA DA MUSICA , estou a um mes assistindo esse Show 😘😍
大好きすぎる、、、、
Cannot get enough of this whole choreo.
Naw was like why??? But that's just me. Love Kris work ethics, but had loved your realness before. It's feels commercial now. Again just my vibe. And who am i 😁
All I see is a very well produced show. Props to the production team
The amount of power this video alone holds is insane
I literally had goosebumps all the time
Mantap penari masal kompak bangat
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💚💚💚
The rude boy segment oh my goooooooodddddddd
And you thought Michael Jackson grabbed his crotch a lot. The synchronicity of so many dancers for so long a performance is amazing. Almost as amazing is when Rihanna's singing continued even when the put the mike to the side.
@brenda williams yes i agree but i saw in ebony magazine that several AFRICAN AMERICAN hollywood celebrities BLEACH THEIR SKIN LIGHTER using strong "professional"strength bleaching products from some international  website called matsui carden beauty whose products make them look far more light skin & mixed race and not look black. Im not really surprised it seems everybody changes their appearance these days.
GODDESS. HANDS DOWN!
💚
Amazing....😍😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
The iconic Rihanna 🥰
I should run my own bloody restaurant seeing how this guy literally freezes frozen pasta
I watched Justina Miles, thanks
😍😍😍😍😍
such a legendddddd
superrrrr🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️
The whole reason of the super bowl performance is to advertise her make-up line 8:15 called Fenty Beauty
Shiloh bros imposters chased
The dancers made the show.💯❤️

Te felicito Ceci, siempre ame tus videos pero desde que empezaste a mostrar a lady gaga te amo mas! Tuve la oportunidad de escucharla en vivo en las Vegas y la verdad lo vale cada dólar que pague esa entrada. Gracias Ceci por compartirnos esto, te amo gaga!!!!
the whole 13 min is classic, love every min of it. I missed her songs for real. I love to cycling with her song " where have you been " fun fun fun time at the gym

Peace for Ukraine.

P.S. I'm Russian.
I watch this at least once at day

For me, this has to be one of the best Super Bowl performances. The stage, the visuals, the vocals, the band, and the dancers it’s beautiful!
Literally the worst Super Bowl performance…
Rihanna’s back up dancers are really dope and cool
Maravillosa Rihanna y excelentes bailarines. Buen trabajo!!!

たまに出てくる、坂田純平くん恋愛バナシは、私の笑い事なんです。いつも。今回は単純に、悪いことをした人を祭り上げの意味で登場してるだけです。
On fire 🔥
白岡の男性とも、って、集団ストーカー員だし、論外です。
機械にも記憶ある私にも恋愛を坂田純平くんとしろと、毎回進められているけど、試したことはないんです。だって、殺人の目的で毒バラまいてるひととあって、好きでもないのに恋愛なんてできないから、って。ボツにしているんです。
啊哈啊啊
Her son is at home watching just glad he isn’t the fetus sloshing around this time lol
私は知らない、なにも。で、記憶ある私は下記のことを、どこかで、思い出して歌ってる、とずっと主張してるんです。ずっと対立しているんです。
記憶ある私によると、ありちゃんのマネをずっとしてるらしい。
純平くんはスペイン語も踊りもできるしセンスもあるのに。どうした？
Tuyệt vời ❤
全部下ネタ。
Me rre encantó fue lo mejor que ah hecho
小学校の夏休みのこと歌ってる。思い出して振り返って、間違っていたけど、いい思い出になったねって。
ありちゃんと坂田純平くん。。
the only flaw of this song is that it ends

Huge respect for playing All of the lights
I was kinda sad that she didn’t sing pon de replay, but her performance was amazing! Some people have been accusing her of lip syncing, I don’t belive it yet, but even if she was , I would understand. She’s pregnant while dancing a bunch! Either way, I still love her, and her music!!!!!!❤️
I like her songs but this performance wasn't it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your so good at singing 🎤🎧🎼🎹
toutes des illuminaties
여성으로서 아티스로서 누릴 수 있는 최고의 영광 브라보 리아나!

Это разнос
Oh my God I love you
Я в восторге от её выступления и вообще от её личности. Но выйти на сцену в током положении это просто ей респект она просто няшка, обожаю удачки и всего  самого наилучшего. 😘😘😘😘
She's more active than mah mom but I still love her
Amazing!!!!!!!!
She was amazing!! I felt like I was in high school again, I remembered all her hits esp Umbrella

Masterpiece!!! ❤❤❤
KANYE
Thought this was Kanye show

gelmıs gecmıs en ıyı performans ,,,,,,,
Those baggy clothes of the dance crew really ruined the choreo now that I saw most of the rehearsals
I NEEDED her to perform Kiss It Better 😒😩…its her best song (to me)
i come here everyday for the Rude Boy moment 4:18
Love the Stank Face.
She's a Beast.
👌ba'al🤘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jeg elsker hendes numse. LIKE HVIS I ER ENIG
That baby in her belly did all the twerking, dancing, singing, jumping jacks all that  along with his/her mommy. 😘😘❤️❤️
How many times I was watched
Gal, am here for the 1000'd time
Min far lavede selvmord
Une femme incroyable
Mon coeur est attaché au tien 💓💓💓💓https://youtu.be/TjBGjEnJHNM
How many times you've watched this? 
Me: Yes! 🙂
Unpopular opinion - The suit that back dancers were wearing they were looking so cute whole dancing in them
Assistindo pela milésima vez quem mais ? Curte aí 🇧🇷
I love u rihanna 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 supermom !
Dünyadaki en iyi şarkılar bu kadına ait sen nesin  be
Bunch of Playback with some dancers while lifting a pregnant woman in the air. Wtf is the point?
Still can't get over with this performance 😭🔥
rihanna forever, talented and brilliant woman 👑💖
What's this song with guitar 🎸 4:39
She is a Badass!!!!!!!
Y’all I can’t believe this was a month ago! Feels like it just happened lol! But anyway am I the only one that goes back and rewatch this performance again…..and to just listen to the music too lol! She killed this ! Song choices on👌🏾 ♥️👑
She looked absolutely beautiful
It's not a perfom, it's actually a concert! The best perform and show settings that I've ever watched! I can't imagine how many efforts the creative team put, how crowded the MCR room, and how painstaking the camera person at the show! I can't stop saying WOW while watching this. I'm pretty sure that one day Rhianna's baby be like "Look at my Mama! She is my mama y'all" Savage!
Illuminati industry DEMONIC AND THEY are all fooled. The devil HATES your GUTS! He is SOOOOO thrilled you're going to Hell with him! 
Change your ways NOW before its too late!
What the hell is this😂😂😂
Much love
During the advanced months of pregnancy, balance is a big problem. Massive respect for her for performing on that floating platform. Great performance.
Wow
Rihanna baby
Super incredible performance. Riri did it again!!.
Just realized I know a lot of Rihanna songs. Thanks to this.
Estos son verdaderos artistas que hacen su fama por su música no por andar metidos en controversias
Grade Rihanna❤️
Disney channels minute men IRL
This is just visually appealing, I love that 
People who hate this performance don’t know art
Amazing!!!
Rn I am laughing at the time boi boi
Why she keep dragging her hand through her own crotch is icky. Like she has a yeast infection and she feeling a little itchy down there. Blech.
Deusa suprema❤
A month ago and Rihanna still creating trending everywhere, only one thing: LEGEND ❤
Wow! This made me LOL! #funny, #gif, #halARIOUS
Poderosaaaa
Eita como é poderosa, icônica Riri❤
Rihanna is a supermacy!!!!
It takes a secure woman to perform with baby weight, and she looks FABULOUS! Huge respect! 🙌
ICONIC 💫❤️🔥
If you think about it, Rihanna predicted that the Chiefs were going to win with the theme of the halftime show(Red and White)
Ri ri starting to look like Ti Ti
The thing started to shake and I thought Rihanna was done for
5:27 that drop was so smooth and lit 🔥 🫡
OMG love
How did she manage to stand in that thing so high and move while also singing and being pregnant? 😯 Hands up to you RIHANNA!!! ❤
🇧🇷 BRABAAAAA
I love Rihanna. Rihanna only ever released bops. That’s why she coulda stood next to a boombox and it would’ve been as effective🤣 sis is a legend in her own right . Nobody else can do her like her!!
Rihanna is my favorite singer😊
It's too bad they had to have a Football game in the middle of a Rihanna concert.
Rihanna is so beautiful 🥰
Not the illuminati symbol at the end
We love your Rihanna
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Excelente ESPECTÁCULAR
Thank you DANCERS!!
Sooo in loveee with her♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The choreography is AMAZING
Rihanna i see that you are an Illuminati. Please help me to become one too! Find me, I will so anything for the organization like your other underlings.
The fact that the most replayed part of this video is the part where she slaps her A** makes me lose faith in humanity.
Ooo my god, Rihanna singing being pregnant on those heights 😰. She must've felt nauseated it takes lots of courage to do this, woww she proves again and again she is" queen of music world". Lots of love for Rhianna and baby 💕
I love the Super Bowl 0:24
i wanted to see the big announcement
The dancing makes me laugh for some reason (in a good way ofc)
Anyone still watching this on repeat or is that just me?
Amazing show! So nice to remember all her beautiful songs 🥰 love it !!
🥰 such an amazing performance!! 👏
She clearly aint afraid of heights……but I sure am😳
🥰🥰🥰🥰oh... my God wow i love Rihanna's

I thought the Shakira halftime performance was way more exciting personally. But the floating platforms was cool for about a whole minute.
Who cares.......
Ohh my God go for damitri

Help me she’s so beautiful 😍 ❤

I will always and forever love Rihanna is an awesome performance and pregnant too. That’s crazy but why do they have to strip the damn illuminati sign heartbreaking but great job mamma!!
Selou
It looks like her backup dancers are just a bunch of tick tock boys
I swear dancers don’t get enough credit
this is so amazing.  Rihanna will always phenomenal❤💝
Rihanna's live performance definition of a millionaire or billionaire. Not so much interesting for me. I think Shakira and JLo are more fun 😅
She’s incredible
It's a sweet song but I don't like the clothes
não entendo o porquê tem tanta gente falando mal do show dela. foi tudo perfeito, muito lindaaaaaaaaaa
Привет риана
Gosh I didn't realize I had listened to so many Rihanna songs over so many years. I know all of these songs, because I had listened to them a lot in different stages of my life.
Show was trash but music selection and staging was fire
Man Rihanna slayyed on this super bowl and oh my goodness the backup dancers, i love them so much, mad respect for them.👏👏👏👏🙌🙌❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love her
dommage que ça soit en playback
Boriiiing
4:17 best part. cant say no to this part..
World class performance!!! I love you rihanna!!!!!
A lot of autotuning theese days on stage during live shows. Who remembers Whitney Houston singing without backing tracks and autotune?
Muito bom mermo gostei maravilhosa  essa mulher
It's a minority thing we don't let nothing geti in the way
Cardio b also perform while being pregnant
Even Justin and pregnant she could dance
She picks the great dancer anyone wants to join riri back up dancer working for riri it's awesome
Thank God Rihanna didn't afraid of heights 😅 that's the best halftime shows btw 💯👍🏼
Beautiful 🥰💕🌟 nice and lovely
ASAP must be a happy man to have her as a wild and his baby mama
That place is packed to
She nail it like always
Amazing
What a brave person she is no doubt people love her soooo much what a performance
Rihannas outfit is a mix of so many celebs like Billies jacket zendeyas top cardi bs red dress aris hairstyle and much more
nice triangle at the end lol.

My channel for kids and welcome everyone🤗
14/03/2023 😳😳😱:

Tenho 35 anos e conheci o som de Rihanna quando ela estourou com Umbrella. Lembro de como eu queria comprar um DVD dela e comprei anos depois. Hoje, um mês após a postagem deste vídeo ela soma mais de 107 milhões de visualizações. Isso é pouco? Claro que não. Além dela ter milhões de pessoas que gostam dela, ela também gera empregos pra muita gente. Olha só quantas pessoas envolvidas nesse espetáculo 🎭. Ela dança com seu baby, lembro da minha primeira filha, trabalhei durante nove meses, até uma sexta-feira e ela nasceu na madrugada do sábado. Ela está radiante, mais do que nunca e olha que carregar um BB, cantar e dançar assim não é pra qualquer um. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🇧🇷❤️
Never knew a 13 :51 min video could have an impact on my life
This is total evil she has committed her life to satan and that sign she did at the ending proves it!
Shiiiii, that intro was dope affff 💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽

Idk about others, but I’d be scared shitless if I were in that levitating stage
She's good and all but the Illuminati sign at the end, no thanks.

Funk brasileiro pro mundo inteiro 😍
1:05 so funny
1:05
Amazingly I really liked her voice so much
1:66 so funny
Best Backup dancers in the world! So In sync wonderful preference
She actually did good considering the fact that she pregnant I mean what y’all expect her to do backflips?! Lol she killed this performance pregnant and all and her voice was up to par
Since 100 people want to complain on her about her performance, their lucky she was pregnant! This is the cleanest I've ever seen her perform and they were amazing!!
the music black people made in the past was amazing. the new generation is shameful
Wow, Rihanna did amazing!! She is super pregnant and still did all of this, as well as sounding amazing. ❤ It is disgusting so many people were dragging her through the mud and saying she should’ve done more.
My Queen 🔥
Rihana i love you
Uma deusa
Rude Boy 🇧🇷👏
Beautiful 😍
Amo a Rhianna. Es una oerformance fuera de serie. Una verdadera showoman!!!!!
10:28 I was waiting for this song ❤
The girl in the background in that one part doing the tiktok dance😂
The noise in the stadium when they realized she preggo. I was worried she'd be outa breath.
2023 ❤
This would be my number one if se he included love on the brain
This is truly the worst super bowl halftime. Also how did some of those men agree to where that.
I love that she is joyful❤ in her craft!!

… and fun fact Pijika is November in Thai word. Her name from her birth month like Gemini.
I love this performance, many people criticize it because according to them it was very simple, but what do they expect from a person who is pregnant, in my opinion it was perfect, I really enjoyed it, riri I love you
I remember when Lucille Ball got flak from being pregnant in public on I Love Lucy . Thank God times have changed.

I Love this song 🎵 Rihnna
Best show ever !
❤
0:32
Best performance ever luv u Rhianna
Rii Rii you were on fire
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really love your music Rihanna but I really don't like the fact on how you treat your fans. Now y'all don't come after me but I am just stating my feelings about her I love her music but not her as a person on how she treats her fans. Now if I were to meet her in person I would say one thing to her. I am proud of her fame but you still need to be a good role model to everyone around you as you are on the public and in the performing industry if you're going to be out there like that just be nice and celebrities always got something negative to do to others and to each other. They are entertainers but still be civilized nice and kind human beings.
Love your halftime show you did great ❤️
❤
the only nfl content ima watch lmao
6:18 this version of the beat is so fire breh
5:21 so iconic
Magnifique ❤
the backup dancers with that white and her in the middle with the drippiest fit is so amazing
2:23 Shes amazing.
😍
rihana is the baby 💓💓💓😻😍😍😍😍😍😁😁😁😁😃🥰🥰😇😇
I do love Rihanna and I dream to see her face!!!
At such a dangerous height on a floating board in pregnancy.  Sounding perfect live when u r out of breath this pregnancy.  She is really an icon and a diva!
It’s okay but not better thn dr Dre 50 cents snoop Dogg etc
I’ve watched this 100 times officially today 😂😂😂 love it!
Eminen
Music was great, dancing was meh haha
How many times did you watch ?
Me : yes
I’m worried for everybody they’re dancing and the last I want to see is Rihanna or her back up dancers falling off the damn hanging stage smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
My girl my girl my girl mmmmyyyyyyyy giiiirrrrrlllllll <3
The worst presentation
I keep watching this every other day. I keep coming back to it. So good!!
PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!
Hope you will come back preforming some day !!  We miss you riri !!
 Amazing like always ! Queen 👑
8:13 You’re welcome!!!
Why She wants to perform such a dangerous act on stage? Apple Music really suck her blood out this time， she’s pregnant oh my god
she found out she was pregnet before she performed
Я извиняюсь, но почему они выглядят как сперматозоиды и матка😥🤔
Rihanna will always be legendary! Imagine people commenting on her grabbing her crotch at a super bowl show...but beer and smoking and drugs are alright? 
If you want a church service, you are in the wrong place...
Beautiful performance👍🏿 I wish I could have been up there shaking my momma body with you! 💗
Why you are here 8:10, all of the lights 🔥
I can't believe that she got one kid and one on the way
Luminati at plain sight! Touching her private and then smelling? What is that about?
I can definitely tell she’s pregnant
Whole times she’s growing life inside her, women are amazing
good dance
Hey
This woman has money she is going to pay all these dancers woooow 💕
That’s my girl starting out with my fave song ❤❤❤❤❤
The star is back!
YAAASS RIH GIVE US NOTHING!!!
Caralhoooo ela usou funk man❤
So simple yet so impactful. The marshmallow dancers stole the show I must say. Hope we get Ciara/Usher next year or Beyoncé…bey is always nice
Great performer
She doesn't need to tell what her legacy is. At all.
Харизма зашкаливает... уже неделю смотрю и наслаждаюсь
PEPTCHO TV Metroid zéro mission 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️😘😘😘😘
Loved it because the songs are all iconic but I feel like it was missing something!
Каждый год мега крутые выступления 👍
She💯 did that
ពិរោះណាស់ ❤❤❤
Ela simplesmente levou o funk para o Super Bowl 🇧🇷❤️‍🔥❤️‍
Rihanna 💗💗💗👏👏Просто ваууууууу крутышка 💣💣💣Выступление 💥💥💥💥💥💥
Rihanna I LOVE YOU !!!
🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Me: *looks at her stomach* 

Also Me: I thought she already had the baby? :I
Dats baeee😍😍😍😍😍
All Rihanna's songs TikTok version is here
Best super bowl performance ever!
The diamond 💎
While I have a deep respect for Rihanna that she's performing so far into her pregancy, which sure wasn't easy, I find the performance extremely boring. But I'm happy for her fans who get to see this and are happy :)
I ❤u ri ri
Una mujer maravillosa
Maravilloso
I watch this performance daily! thanks Rihanna for this incredible show!!!
Kerennn bgt
I just wanted to say, WE WON'T STOOP COMING BACK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥, this is HISTORY. Y'all can say what you want to say.
The baby inside:⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️
107M❤
I don't know if she is the only performer who sing playback. Just my point of view...
I love her and she's amazing but her micro went sometimes to early away from her mouth no hate but she could be lipsinging a little so ye shes amazing and I'm not trying to give hate I just wanna say that😊
Rihanna ❤️‍🔥
The fact that she did this when she was pregnant and this has only been out for a month yet has more views than other halftime shows that have been around for YEARS goes to show Rihanna's Is The Goat
best half time show ik im late just forgot to comment
hasta embarazada es hermosa  😘😘🤗 amo a rihanna.!
4.18sec rude boy..
Je l'aime trop ces ma préférée je voud jure
Isso é magnífico! Uma baita estrutura, uma organização impecável e essa sincronia! 😱👏👏👏
Why are so many people praising those performance? First off this is supposed to be kid friendly. The dance moves and lyrics were not. Still that can be overlooked which is no problem. Second, anyone in the industry could have song these songs. She just happened to be the Guinea pig they chose. Probably because she’s a yes man and doesn’t ask questions. Beyoncé, Shakira hell even Shania Twain could perform these songs. Had they been released under those artists, they’d still be hits. You would never know. She doesn’t write these songs or choreograph any of the performances. If she did, then that could be classified as talent. I could talk about this one forever. Third, she has a baby in her! She’s been pregnant for quite a while based on what we saw. Just think about that fact alone for a minute. If you don’t see anything wrong with that then you’re probably one of these clowns encouraging it. Wake up and think for yourself. Stop listening to what’s being shoved down our throats and be your own person. There’s more but I’ll leave it this now. Watch all these people come rushing to her defense now. Even though Rihanna has never even seen you or heard your name.
She did a beautiful job she sounds amazing live
Gratidão diva, maravilhada😘 Sempre surpreende.
Parabéns!!!
Come on, RIHANNA may be the star here, but the dancers brought the whole show.
Anybody can fall in love with rehana after watching this😍😍😍😍😍
Masterpiece man
This legend literally proving women's power at its finest
Lol a transgender 😅man giving birth to the new world order
Clairement la meilleure !!! INCROYABLEEEEE Performance !!! 😍😍🤩🤩💗💗
Imagine michael jackson throwing a half time performance with todays technology!
Am glad she sang All of the Lights and Run this Town. They were and still are hit songs. Period.
Yeah but I don't like the way Bill Goldberg and Donald Trump say mean thing's about Rihanna but if I would have seen her real person I would give her a hug she is so expression two other people in this capture of this music my idle
SHE MADES A BETTER SHOW THAN RIHANNA ...FOR SURE !!
Rihanna has such a presence that i was watching this so impressed and in awe, almost crying from excitement, even though i’ve never been a fan. ( love some of her songs without rly knowing they’re hers lol)
ILOVEYOU RIRI!!!!! IM CRYIN
I'm literally that 100 M views  .. 👋
❤
5:25 is what brought me here🤣🤣

Rihannanın bu şova hamileyken katılması ve yinede bu kadar çok sükse yapması büyük başarı....takımı bunu bilerek tasarlamış.

ARIANA GRANDE NEXT 😭
Это выступление показало,что ожидать человечеству😂😂😂Мадонна уже в своём  выступлении показала и сейчас мы это проходим😂😂😂(война в Украине).
WOW!
I'm sorry but what the F**K is this choreography, is this the current standard of Western music performances now? I mean the dancers were great, but the choreo was so monotonous and uninspired, it looked like a PE session at school, ive seen amateur buskers in South Korea do better.
My god listen to her at 3:25! Her voice was so weak and banging sounds had tk do the work 😂😂😂. All you clowns 🤡 sting oh how good she was etc really have no clue.
Hats off 😮
好優秀❤❤❤❤❤❤！
This is two guys. on the stage. Have a baby and princess girl. I hope you make me fight for listen your song
Rihanna I love you so much ❤️❤️💯✌️
I didn’t get a chance to watch the half time show but had heard and read some negative things about it… Why???  After watching it just now my take on it is that it was fabulous.  I loved it!  Creative, entertaining, great dancing and her voice is amazing.  And to top it off, she did all this while pregnant!
They said Rihanna didn't get paid to perform at the Superbowl they should have paid her for her concert the NFL could afford to pay her
❤❤❤
what kind of stupid thing ther are producing
#queen #slay #daddyqueen
RIRI slayed it💙🧨
Mother
I want to say a word about amazing choreographer’s work and dancers❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Everything played a crucial part for such tremendous performance✨✨✨
i love this dancing crew ❤
amazing my idol ❤❤❤❤
Rewatch

Eita como não cansa de ser perfeita❤
In a world where pregnant women are sometimes discriminated against, her performance is a moral boost to all pregnant women out there that they can do whatever they want to do pregnant or not.
This was one of the best SHTS. Please take the ads off.
Ela é maravilhosaaaaaaaaaaaa

Rihanna's HalfTimeShow 2023 is the BEST ever seen on a SuperBowl and she performed her 'Shine Bright like a Diamond' so wonderful to set a statement for ETERNITY 
serious this is the best 13:50 Mins of my life am giddy at every transition🤗
Rihanna supporting kanye
Sin dudas la put@ ama!!!
😂 have u guys seen the new meme
Great job Right❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I remembered when she stated she wanted to become an icon like Beyonce. She has done it and even more. Good job RiRi 
Thanks be to God

Ausgenommen von diesem Trottel mit der Wischmobfrisur aka Donald T. hat es jedem gefallen!
I loved the performance, even when I got nervous by the fact of imagining the vertigo of being over those platforms in movement. Rihanna is a complete diva and star singing pregnant over all those facts. I'd be completely petrified If I being so high.
Que puesta en escena más espectaculaaaar ❤ Todo fue Perfecto, de los mejores halftime show que haya visto ❤
Классно, но всё-таки хочется уступить место чтобы она присела))) оформление, саунд, хореография и постановка на высшем уровне. Работали профессионалы - вот им и аплодисменты.
What a great performance Riri wow..keep on blessing us🥰❤️

Единственная исполнительница у которой небыло ни одного плохо комментария.
Ее любит  весь мир!
Была на ее выступлении)
God does not like that, so stop it and take it off of YouTube
Rihanna is beautiful and this was a classic half-time show. I thought I loved Prince the most but she gave him some real competition. She is a beautiful, talented woman.
She's so pretty they made it so good cuz it's. A baby
Never thought I'd see a halftime show worse than the Weekends!!!
Rihanna iss so pretty I hope she's having a girl 💖💖💖🍼
🔥🔥
❤️
She’s overrated coz she’s pregnant 😊
Iluminati .....un show bad
♥️
♥️♥️♥️
Such a excellent performance !!!
Lit,,best voice
😮‍💨❤️🫶🏽🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
It never stops being iconic. It just doesn't. I-CO-NIC!
Would have been cooler if she actually sang her songs like the team did last year. Its literally prerecorded and shes singing over-herself. Plus no collab, no reason to get excited to see more people.. Last years was far better for the nostalgia alone
🇺🇸 Our Beautiful Barbadian Princess 🇧🇧
Best of luck to Rihanna in her private life👍
👏👏👏👏👏❤️
Damn she’s a super star 😊
All choreograph and the dancers make me happy laugh. 😂😂
Yuh performance sell off,...epic mumma. A yaad man a seh dat

See me doing dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
Iconic period
ASL was more entertaining than Rihanna's performance.
love the music
The two people before the end were just having fun 😂😂
I'm not gonna be surpirsed if RIhanna name the baby "Diamond", cuz "You're beautiful like diamond in the sky" literally when she sung it in the sky.
Happy Sunday! ❤️🖤 
Rihanna te amo! 
This is a perfect medley of her songs though a few are missing like Disturbia and S& M. 
Praise the back-up dancers for their job. 
The best song was at the end "Diamonds" 💎💙. The stadium with the lights looked amazing.
She makes it look so effortless.
Wait, it is no longer Pepsi Halftime Show?
Eversince i heard umbrella I knew it.
Wow Rihanna performance another level. Dancer are amazing best performance for decades. 😍
The walking dead theme not on the playlist yet…
This lady is a lowkey beast…. A modern day Queen.  She kept it classy while giving a hot, energetic performance.
more than 3 weeks and I am still listening every fn day Rhianna is a legend!!
Powerful woman
I love you riri
Is hi pregnant 🤰 🤔💖
Love you
My favorite singer 😍❤️😍😍😍
Lets get more views
ГОСПОДИ, ОНА БОГИНЯ!!!!!
The best superbowl ever
masonic symbol?
You killed it boo
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life 😂😅
So cute performance yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wooh
Ya
Stunning!!
I always pray for her to get saved and sing to the Lord Jesus Christ....to equalized by bringing people from darkness to the Lord 😍🥰😘I love her and she is one of my role model not because of music but her entrepreneurship and humanitarian spirit.... Bebe Angel and Park Shin Hye are my best role model too
Iconic 😍❤️
обожаю её
SUCH A MASTERPIECE
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwq
Last year's was WAY BETTER
This is a really amazing performance! It’s so her. I love how she separates herself from “what’s trending”. She’s in a lane by herself! She created that damn lane!
rihanna's my favorite singer and this changed my life
Wow, just wow
Worst show ever sucked so bad
❤
I also want Disturbia , monster , s&m …
her voice is still soo good she is still amazingg and her bops will always be hits
En mis 47 años nunca había puesto una bachata para yo escucharla, pero han hablado tanto de esta que la puse y me encantó. Deberíamos hacerla viral como la de Shakira. Y no las porquerías de la que salió con bigotes en los premios.
Am I the only one whose anxiety was building up whenever she was doing her steps or stunts ;-;-;;
Okay i get that her performance was great and all but also why is no one talking about the triangle sign she made with her hand at the ending of her last song diamonds ??
Сатанистка, бл
Awesome 🎉🎉🎉
Невероятное выступление🔥🔥 какая же она классная💔
Was so glued to this that I screamed when the commercial came on....she performed beautifully
WOW ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
🎉🎉
The greastest performance of all time
the illuminati are back slay
Who is still a fan of her still? 🐧🐗🐹
Meanwhile the baby: 🥁
Basically you are saying
1. She practiced all this being pregnant
2. She actually performed it on a moving platform suspended on harnesses while being pregnant without even making even one mistake and same awesome voice.
3. She had the energy to go to the practice sessions everyday WHILE BEING PREGNANT. 

OH GODDD, SOO HARDWORKING 🥺♥️
.
I will never get sick and tired of watching this. Best halftime show!!!
sahneye tanrı çıkıyor..
Legend and Queen of ALL generations!!!
Keep the prego ladies away from the super bowl next time please.
Omg she having a baby
In je buik zit er een jongen of een meisje.❤
She's the best i listen for 15 years ago <3
Huge respect for the backup dancers too...
Your performing with ur baby diaper
La mejor reina del caribe
I am super cool
Riana ibelive to pefourmas 
Super dance and song 
I love you ❤❤❤❤
I saw that one dancer, dancing a TikTok dance lol
13:03 Illuminati sign ☢️🤐
Goosebumps at the end, the whole stadium was dazzling
Rihanna,s
Dropped by to see what all the hype was about and true enough... It's all just hype. 😑
SO UGLY AND STANIC ..PRAY TO GOD TO SAVE YOU

I’ve seen the rehearsal they looked so cool but In the final performance they all looked like a bunch of baby spookums except Rihanna..who slayed as always 😍 …
5:21 my dog whenever my mum brings the shopping back inside the house💀
She made all of my childhood songs and 99% of them I didn’t even know they were her 😂😂
Love Rihanna from Tanzania 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Una mujer embarazada dando el medio tiempo, Rihanna es la mejor 🎉❤

I love Rihanna but who doesn’t… but I just wanna say, I love her and ASAP Rocky together. They’re so perfect together in my opinion. Im so glad she didn’t settle down with Drake or Chris Brown.
She did an amazing job
Lol

Best half time superbowl
And no yt people complaining to the FCC like they did JLo and Shakira
